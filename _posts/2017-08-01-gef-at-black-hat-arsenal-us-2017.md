## GEF at Black Hat Arsenal US 2017 ##

I've had the privilege to be invited to
present my tool [`GEF`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef)
at [Black Hat Arsenal](https://blackhat.com) organized
by [ToolsWatch](https://toolswatch.org) in Las Vegas this year.

I did prepare a bunch of things for this presentation, including a good
polishing of the docs, and a series of screencasts for people new to the tool,
so they can start using the best features straight away.

You can find the presentation slides {%include link.html title="here"
href="/static/bhusa_2017/BH-USA-17-Alladoum-GDB-Enhanced-Features.pdf"%} and the {%include link.html title="Youtube playlist" href="https://goo.gl/1QAZM4"%} for the screencasts
to start learning using it, and some of its best features.

Thank you to those who attended (especially with the collision with the lunch
period â˜¹ ), and as usual if you have questions, feel free to reach out.

Cheers !
