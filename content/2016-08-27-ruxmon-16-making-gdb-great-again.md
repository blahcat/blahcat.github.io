### Ruxmon August 2016: Making GDB great again ###

I did a small presentation last Friday at [Ruxmon Melbourne](https://web.archive.org/web/20231209215029/http://ruxmon.com/melbourne/) about GDB, its Python API and how it can be used to make awesome new stuff.

I also gave demos of my tool [`gef`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef.git), an architecture-agnostic exploitation helper for GDB to show the awesomeness of [Python API](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html) for GDB.

Find the [PDF slides here](http://christophe.alladoum.free.fr/public/ruxmon-08-16/ruxmon_2016-09_gdb_enhanced_features.pdf)

And send me your insults/feedbacks on [gef new IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##gef)!
