## GEF at Black Hat Arsenal US 2017 ##

I had the privilege to be invited to present my tool [`GEF`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef){:target="_blank"} at [Black Hat Arsenal](https://blackhat.com){:target="_blank"} organized by [ToolsWatch](https://toolswatch.org){:target="_blank"} in Las Vegas this year.

I did prepare a bunch of things for this presentation, including a good polishing of the docs, and a series of screencasts for people new to the tool, so they can start using the best features straight away.

You can find the presentation slides [here](http://christophe.alladoum.free.fr/public/blackhat-2017/BH-USA-17-Alladoum-GDB-Enhanced-Features.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the [tutorial playlist on YouTube](https://goo.gl/1QAZM4){:target="_blank"} for the screencasts to start learning using it, and some of its best features.

Thank you to those who attended (especially with the collision with the lunch period â˜¹ ), and as usual if you have questions, feel free to reach out.

Cheers !
