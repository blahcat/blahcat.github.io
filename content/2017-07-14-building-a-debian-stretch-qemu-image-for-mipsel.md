### Introduction ###

After releasing [the QEMU images](/posts/2017/06/25/qemu-images-to-play-with.html) I've created to test [`GEF`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef), I've received tons of demands from people asking for more images, but also for some DYI procedures.

As [`@Fox0x01`](https://twitter.com/Fox0x01) already covered fairly exhaustively [how to build an QEMU ARMv6 compatible VM](https://azeria-labs.com/emulate-raspberry-pi-with-qemu/), through this blog post I intend to provide a step-by-step how-to on building a Debian Stretch Malta MIPS32el image.

{% note() %}
There is no miracle here, I've just spend a long time googling for solution every time I was facing a problem. This tuto is more for a being a personal reminder for the future times I need to build an image ðŸ˜Š

### Pre-requisites ###

For the Debian MIPS net installer, the `initrd` **is** the installation
device. No need to download any ISO or such, simply download:
- the initrd (the distro installer):

```bash
$ wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian9.13/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/malta/netboot/initrd.gz
```

- a kernel to boot on:

```bash
$ wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian9.13/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/malta/netboot/vmlinux-4.9.0-13-4kc-malta
```

You also need a hard drive to install the OS on:
```bash
$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow2 20G
```

Since we're using the Debian net installer, we will need an Internet connection. Also don't be surprised to see your CPU activity jump up and your fans get louder!


## Installing Debian

Start the installation with:

```bash
$ qemu-system-mipsel -M malta -m 1G \
  -hda ./disk.qcow2 \
  -initrd ./initrd.gz \
  -kernel ./vmlinux-4.9.0-4-4kc-malta -append "nokaslr" \
  -nographic
```

The kernel boot option `nokaslr` is required or you'll get an error when the
kernel will try to decompress `initrd`. The reason is:

> [...] that QEMU loads the initrd into the memory
> immediately after the kernel, but that bit of memory might get
> overwritten by KASLR when the kernel starts and relocates itself.
> You can workaround it by passing "-append nokaslr" to QEMU, [...]

Then your MIPSel (Malta-flavor) system boots, and you end up in the regular
`ncurses` Debian installer.

Let the installer do its magic.

{{ img(src="https://i.imgur.com/Lg6Db5x.png" title="3.debian.partition.png") }}

Since it's a VM for test and lab stuff, the guided partitioning is more than
enough (and select `All files in one partition`). Feel free to tweak that part.

{{ img(src="https://i.imgur.com/iv31UxH.png" title="2.debian.installation.png") }}

I usually install only the minimum OS to get a running shell once I boot. For
there I install everything from `apt-get`. With a proper `openssh-server`
installed, I then create 2 scripts:

  - `start.sh` with all the good QEMU parameters, to launch the VM in
    non-graphic mode, and set up the port forward on tcp/22
  - `ssh.sh` to connect to the VM.

Debian will detect no boot loader, and show the following warning:

{{ img(src="https://i.imgur.com/fuxZCDU.png" title="7.debian.end_installer.png") }}

So remember to append `root=/dev/sda1` to `-append` option before running your
Qemu.

Then the installation will finish successfully:

### Fixing the last quirks ###

If you try to boot directly the VM by simply removing the `-initrd` line, the
kernel will panic like this:
```bash
end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
```

We must extract the `initrd` image from the installation: to do so you must
mounting the QEMU disk via the
[Network Block Device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device)
kernel module `nbd`:

```bash
$ sudo apt install nbd-client
$ sudo modprobe nbd max_part=8
$ sudo qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 disk.qcow2
$ mkdir mnt
$ sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 mnt
```

Extract the initramfs file (`initrd.img`) from `MOUNT_PATH/boot/`

```bash
$ cp mnt/boot/initrd.img-4.9.0-4-4kc-malta . && sync
```

And unmount the NBD device.
```bash
$ sudo umount /dev/nbd0p1
$ sudo nbd-client -d /dev/nbd0
```

You can now boot the VM with the following command:
```bash
$ qemu-system-mipsel -M malta -m 1G \
  -hda ./disk.qcow2 \
  -initrd ./initrd.img-4.9.0-4-4kc-malta \
  -kernel ./vmlinux-4.9.0-4-4kc-malta -append "nokaslr root=/dev/sda1" \
  -nographic
```

{{ img(src="http://i.imgur.com/6h0Wxed.png" title="9.first.boot.png") }}

On all the images I've created, Debian doesn't properly DHCP the Ethernet
interface (get a wrong name for the interface), so it must be done manually at
the first boot (use `ip -a` to show the interface name):
```bash
# cat > /etc/network/interfaces << EOF
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface enp0s18 inet dhcp
EOF
# shutdown -h now
```

You can now use the `start.sh` script to init the VM, and `ssh.sh` to SSH to it
as `user`.

The `start.sh` usually looks like
```bash
#!/bin/bash

KERNEL=./vmlinux-4.9.0-4-5kc-malta
INITRD=./initrd.img-4.9.0-4-5kc-malta
HDD=./disk.qcow2
SSH_PORT=22055
EXTRA_PORT=33055

qemu-system-mips64el -M malta -m 512 -cpu MIPS64R2-generic \
                   -kernel ${KERNEL} \
                   -initrd ${INITRD} \
                   -hda ${HDD} \
                   -net nic,model=e1000 \
                   -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:${SSH_PORT}-:22,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:${EXTRA_PORT}-:4444 \
                   -display none -vga none -nographic \
                   -append 'nokaslr root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0'

exit 0
```

And the `ssh.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Existing users : 'root/root' & 'user/user'"
ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 22055 user@127.0.0.1 -- $*
exit 0
```

For Windows, simply convert `script.sh` to Batch.

### Download the new images ###

Since I've built in parallel a Malta MIPS32el and MIPS64el for this tutorial,
both have been added to the [folder on Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/#F!oMoVzQaJ!iS73iiQQ3t_6HuE-XpnyaA)

The MIPS64el was created **exactly** the same way, except that QEMU required the
proper CPU version to boot correctly:

```bash
$ qemu-system-mips64el -M malta -cpu MIPS64R2-generic -m 1G \
  -hda ./disk.qcow2 \
  -initrd ./initrd.gz \
  -kernel ./vmlinux-4.9.0-4-5kc-malta -append "nokaslr" \
  -nographic
```

The adequate files were downloaded from
[here](http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/), then choose your wanted version (here, `Debian9.13`) and go to `main/installer-mips64el` to download the installer files.


### A few known issues ###

  - The kernel doesn't boot the `initrd`: from my experience on it, either your
    initrd is incorrect, or try to append proper kernel boot options
    (`-append`).

  - The error `WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations` appears often:
    that's a QEMU warning from
    [`os_host_main_loop_wait()`](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/util/main-loop.c#L219) and
    the code provides a good description of the issue:

```bash
/** If the I/O thread is very busy or we are incorrectly busy waiting in
  * the I/O thread, this can lead to starvation of the BQL such that the
  * VCPU threads never run.  To make sure we can detect the later case,
  * print a message to the screen.  If we run into this condition, create
  * a fake timeout in order to give the VCPU threads a chance to run.
  */
```

  - For simplicity, I highly recommend to only use the official repo (from
    `deb.debian.org` or `mirrors.kernel.org`). It might be a bit slower than
    your local mirror, but mirrors do not always mirror **all** the
    architectures generated by Debian maintainers.


### Conclusion ###

That's how you get started with making your own QEMU images. Debian, as the real
hacker distro it is, is usually the one that works best for trying weird
combination, and MIPS CPUs are very well supported. More posts will come on
building other QEMU images for other ABI, which are not necessarily that easy to
setup.

I hope you now have all the information to make your own QEMU images.
