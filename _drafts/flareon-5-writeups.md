It's already been a year, and here I am again, playing
[Flare-On 2018](https://2018.flare-on.com), 5th edition, and what crazy ride it was.
The good fellows at [FireEye](https://fireeye.com) really outdid themselves. A big trend for this year was clearly around virtual machines, but some good new topics were also present (such as WebAssembly).

Just like last year, same formula: 6 weeks, 12 reversing challenges, 12 flags (all ending with `@flare-on.com`). All challenges can be downloaded
[from this Mega.nz repo](https://mega.nz/#!zVRWyKab!Zty1fpEMSwAQMVptObQBQ_PWUrEEPz8espENP4F15F0).

{% include note.html text="This writeup was made mostly for me to keep track of what I did during those challenges. I don't claim any particular technique to be original, and [much better writeups can be found elsewhere](https://bruce30262.github.io/flare-on-challenge-2018-write-up/).

# The Arsenal #

Surprisingly, I did happen to use the same arsenal than the one from
[last year](/2017/10/13/flareon-4-writeups/#the-arsenal) - also because some challenges were inspired from
last year, but we'll get to that - and it just worked like a charm!

**Note**: just like year, I have no claim of my solution being the best. In some cases I ended up doing
some really dirty things to get to my ends. You might want to check out the official solution PDF for
better directives on how the challenge was made. That being said, let's go for FlareOn 5!



# The Challenges #

## Challenge 1 ##

### Instructions ###

#### Minesweeper Championship Registration

```
Welcome to the Fifth Annual Flare-On Challenge! The Minesweeper World Championship is coming soon
and we found the registration app. You weren't officially invited but if you can figure out what the
code is you can probably get in anyway. Good luck!
```


### Solution ###

Trivial quick-off, the flag can be see using any Java decompiler (I like `jadx`):

```java
if (response.equals("GoldenTicket2018@flare-on.com")) {
  [...]
```

## Challenge 2

### Instruction

#### Ultimate Minesweeper

```
You hacked your way into the Minesweeper Championship, good job. Now its time to compete. Here is
the Ultimate Minesweeper binary. Beat it, win the championship, and we'll move you on to greater
challenges.
```

### Solution

```bash
$ ls -lah ./2/UltimateMinesweeper.exe
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hugsy hugsy 1.2M Jun 25 07:27 ./2/UltimateMinesweeper.exe
$ file ./2/UltimateMinesweeper.exe
./2/UltimateMinesweeper.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows
```

This time as well, not too much of a mysterie: using `dnspy`, it is possible to spot a `GetKey()` static method in
`MainForm` which appears to do some "crypto" to check the following key:

```python
>>> key = [245, 75, 65, 142, 68, 71, 100, 185, 74, 127, 62, 130, 231, 129,
          254, 243, 28, 58, 103, 179, 60, 91, 195, 215, 102, 145, 154, 27,
          57, 231, 241, 86]
```

I noticed that the `GetKey()` method only has 2^32 possibilities for keys (because of the bound limitation of UInt32).
So I copied / pasted into a custom C# program to bruteforce it, and checking whether the result had `@flareon-com` in the
end:

{% include gist.html id="9cc37a8603a6bab816e2d574fca39cec" name="Solve.cs" %}


And after a few minutes:
```bash
$ dotnet run
Success
Ch3aters_Alw4ys_W1n@flare-on.com
```

## Challenge 3

### Instructions

#### FLEGGO

```
When you are finished with your media interviews and talk show appearances after that crushing
victory at the Minesweeper Championship, I have another task for you. Nothing too serious, as you'll
see, this one is child's play.
```

### Solution

Inside the challenge archive was a total of 48 PEs. Using `dhex` showed that those
binaries were actually *very* similar up until byte 0x2B00. Also using `CFF Explorer`,
I spotted an extra Resource in the Resource Directory `BRICK`, whose content was a UTF-16
string distinct to each executable, that could be revealed by `strings`:

```bash
$ strings  -e l FLEGGO/dnAciAGVdlovQFSJmNiPOdHjkM3Ji18o.exe
@BRICK
%s\%s
IronManSucks
Oh, hello Batman...
I super hate you right now.
What is the password?
%15ls
Go step on a brick!
Oh look a rainbow.
Everything is awesome!
%s => %s
BRICK
ZYNGeumv6QuI7
```

Just running the program doesn't do much, except asking for a password:

```bash
$ wine FLEGGO/dnAciAGVdlovQFSJmNiPOdHjkM3Ji18o.exe
What is the password?
foobar
Go step on a brick!
```

After a few attempts copy/pasting the strings found above, I realized the password
was the strings located in BRICK resource directory. If the password is found,
an PNG file is dumped on disk and the program also outputs a letter.
```bash
âžœ  wine FLEGGO/dnAciAGVdlovQFSJmNiPOdHjkM3Ji18o.exe
What is the password?
ZYNGeumv6QuI7
Everything is awesome!
15566524.png => e
```

So I made a Python script to automatically dump everything:
```python
import glob, os, subprocess

for exe in glob.glob("FLEGGO/*.exe"):
    # get password
    l = [ x.strip() for x in subprocess.check_output("strings -e l {}".format(exe), shell=True).splitlines() if len(x.strip()) ]
    p = l[-1]
    print("Got password '{}' for '{}'".format(p, exe))
    # replay it to get the png
    os.system("echo {} | wine {}".format(p, exe))
```

If we run that:
```bash
$ py solve.py
Got password 'Z8VCO7XbKUk' for 'FLEGGO/K7HjR3Hf10SGG7rgke9WrRfxqhaGixS0.exe'
What is the password?
Everything is awesome!
72263993.png => h
Got password 'ohj5W6Goli' for 'FLEGGO/SeDdxvPJFHCr7uoQMjwmdRBAYEelHBZB.exe'
What is the password?
Everything is awesome!
65626704.png => 3
[...]
```

So in the end, we've got 48 PNG files, to all of which were assigned a letter, probably
from the final flag:

![](/img/flareon-2018/12268605.png)

So we have a letter associated to an image, and a number (an index) inside that image. So it doesn't
take a genius that we need to gather all that together, and that's it, using some `grep`/`sed`/`awk`-fu
the flag is ours:

```
mor3_awes0m3_th4n_an_awes0me_p0ssum@flare-on.com
```

## Challenge 4

### Instructions

### binstall

```
It is time to get serious. Reverse Engineering isn't about toys and games. Sometimes its
about malicious software. I recommend you run this next challenge in a VM or someone
else's computer you have gained access to, especially if they are a Firefox user.
```

### Solution

See the hint in the instruction: the binary is doing something fishy, and that
has something to do with Firefox. Let's keep it in mind...

```
$ ls -lah binstall.exe
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hugsy hugsy 182K Aug 21 13:57 ./binstall.exe
$ file binstall.exe
binstall.exe: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows
```

So we're facing a not that small .Net PE file (32 bits). Using `dnSpy`, I saw that the binary was mostly doing the following (from a high level point of view):

  1. Decodes a DLL (`browserassist.dll`) hardcoded encoded in array of UInts. The decoded result is stash into `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\browserassist.dll`.
  1. Deletes the cache of all Web browsers
  1. Disable DLL signature enforcement (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs` to 0) and enables [`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\LoadAppInit_DLLs`](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/197571) and defines `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs` with the path to this DLL in the registry hive.

At this point we have a DLL that will be injected by the Windows loader into all processes, so I started analyzing it. When facing a DLL I usually like to create a small loader in C. That allows me to easily interact with any function (exported or not from the binary), set breakpoints, etc. and looks something like this (its name is important, as we'll see later):

{% include gist.html  id="de61415fb3bb9edb81dd7db8e4807a5b" name="firefox.c" %}

The DLL is a hooking library that starts by sending an HTTP request to http://pastebin.com/raw/hvaru8NU, generates a decoding key partially built with the loader  image name: if the image name is `firefox.exe` then the generated key (`FL@R3ON.EXE`), will decode correctly the data and proceed. Therefore this hooking library only targets Firefox (remember the hint?). Once decoded, we get the JSON file:

{% include gist.html  id="15453d36db4183ebe59d0d606db508f9" %}

Then the DLL will look up the functions `PR_Read()` and `PR_Write()` from `nss3.dll` and `nspr4.dll`, responsible for the SSL/TLS encryption of Firefox, and install hooks on them to allow the JSON rules to take effect. Knowing what the DLL did, I moved to examining the JSON itself which was quite explicit as to which pages were hooked:

```
[...]
        "path": "/js/model.js",
        "host": "*flare-on.com"
[...]
```

And what should be replaced:

```
[...]
            "before": "function askPassword(){model.curIndex++, ...
[...]
            "after": "else if (d === (27).toString(36).toLowerCase().split('')...
[...]
```

[Beautifying and then decoding](https://gist.github.com/fb6daa910ef8191098f3e13333792f1a) each block of JavaScript from the plugin reveals a new command on Flare-On website, `su` which takes a password that can be found statically too, from the plugin. Ultimately we could call `de(InputData, password="k9btBW7k2y")` which gives the flag:

```
c0Mm4nD_inJ3c7ioN@flare-on.com
```

## Challenge 5

### Instructions

#### web2.0

```
The future of the internet is here, again. This next challenge will showcase some the exciting new technologies paving the information super-highway for the next generation.
```


### Solution


This challenge was much easier than the level 4. We're left with a WASM file `test.wasm`. Having worked on WASM recently, I knew there were several approaches, but I decided to be lazy and use {% include link.html text="wasm2c" href="https://pepyakin.github.io/wabt/wasm2c/index.html" %} online to generate a pseudo-C file for me. Once cleaned up, I had a compilable C file

{% include gist.html  id="f17ed2ce301cca2cfe8526c4ef0d2e8b" name="decompiled.c" %}

The C file was not easy to read or reverse.
WebAssembly is a very simplistic VM, and a single simple C instruction (like `int x = a + b`) has to be translated into plenty of instructions. So the idea behind my approach was to benefit from compilers optimizations to simplify the heavy C file, which I could then provide to IDA's Hex-Rays, and get me a more simple form to RE.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wo8Uy5z.png)

It was then trivial to isolate what the indirect functions called were doing (`or`, `not`, `add`, `sub`, `copy_byte`, `xor`)

![](https://i.imgur.com/4cYDDFD.png)

The key is 32 characters long compared one-by-one, and by tracing the execution reveals what values it was compared against:

{% include image.html src="/img/flareon-2018/L5-flag.png" %}

## Challenge 6

### Instructions

#### magic

```
Wow you are a really good reverse engineer! Keep it up! You can do it!

How to tell if your child is a computer hacker:
1. They are using Lunix, an illegal hacker operating system
2. Are they struggling to maintain contact with the outside world, due to spending their time reading gibberish on the computer screen
```


### Solution

This challenge reveals `magic`, an obfuscated ELF file that requires to enter 666 valid keys. Each of those keys is divided into 33 sub-parts, given by 33 functions which appeared (wrongly) to be different. Actually by taking a close look at the assembly, I realized that there are (only) 8 unique functions performing crypto operations. So the program operates roughly like this

```
EncodedBlockAtFixedAddress = {...};
while i < 33
{
  DecodeBlock(i, KeyPart[i])
}
```

If everything goes well and the key is valid, the binary got self-mutated by the input of the key. Since those addresses are static, it was possible to create a tool to

 1. Load the code and data into its own memory
 2. Unxor the initial code buffer
 3. Bruteforce each character to get the 1/33th part of the _i_th key
 4. Loop 33 times to get a whole key

{% include gist.html id="69551c411acd779f67c379108b1f0237" name="solve.c" %}

Since `solve.c` is capable of bruteforcing one key, another wrapper was necessary to bruteforce the 666 keys, and take into consideration the mutations:

{% include gist.html id="36bb1dc6f3d99da5c7db491111a93a38" name="final.py" %}

Then was time for a good coffee while watching the monitor:

<video width="800" height="600" controls>
  <source src="/img/flareon-2018/L6-flag.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>



Validating the ultimate key would grant us the flag:
```
Congrats! Here is your price:
mag!iC_mUshr00ms_maY_h4ve_g!ven_uS_Santa_ClaUs@flare-on.com
```

Half of the challenges, done!

after 2 days of RE hyper-v part, {% include icon-twitter.html username="@0xcpu" %} hinted me that reversing the hyper-v is irrelevant so I focused on the VM itself.

identified interesting opcodes

## 11 - malware skillz


### challenge

```
We captured some malware traffic, and the malware we think was responsible. You know
the drill, if you reverse engineer and decode everything appropriately you will
reveal a hidden message. This challenge thinks its the 9th but it turned out too hard,
so we made it the 11th.
```


### solution

LaunchAccelerator.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

display `launch.exe.png` and drop `crackme.exe` on the desktop



#### timeline

cli1 = 192.168.221.91 (johnjackson-pc\\john.jackson)
cli2 = 192.168.221.105 (larryjohnson-pc\\larry.johnson)
dnssrv =  192.168.221.2
c2srv = 52.0.104.200

-----------
dns2tcp like from cli1  ->  dnssrv
notatallsuspicio.us TXT packets
b64 payload extracted in dns-out.b64
looks encrypted ( TODO )

-----------

then at pkts[3281] cli1 -> DNS A to analytics.notatallsuspicio.us (replies with ip c2srv)
cli1 -> tcp conn to :9443
looks encrypted too (not ssl tho)

custom protocol

struct _header {
  DWORD type

}
51


-----------

then cli1 -> SMB2 to cli2

challenge based of 2017 L12 challenge

did not reverse the crypto, RE the `dump2.dll` DLL to see that it can both handle client & server
comm.

hardpatch dump2.dll to create a PE exec -> dump6.exe

with frida + socat + npiperelay I managed to expose the service on 9443/tcp
then I could simply send any packet of data and hook 402B09 to dump decoded data

comm HTTP, visit of web page -> leak password to level9.zip

then smb comm embeds the same protocol, but nonces are also exchanged so I could still reuse my
tool chain

-> dumped cryptor.exe (.Net bin) that simply AES encrypt data (+ control checks on files added)

it leaked the key+iv location on Github
wrote `decrypt.py` -> got level9.zip

unzipped with password found in HTML page (MoinMoin wiki)
-> got level9.exe and level9.png (appears blank - all white)

level9.exe is a simple "stegano" tool that will output an image with a password in it
assuming level9.png was generated with it, simply wrote `decode-image.py` to spot non white pixel ,
make then appear black

result in -> `final-flag.png`

## Challenge 12

### Instructions

#### Suspicious Floppy Disk

```
Now for the final test of your focus and dedication. We found a floppy disk that was given to spies
to transmit secret messages. The spies were also given the password, we don't have that information,
but see if you can figure out the message anyway. You are saving lives.
```

### Solution


```
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -s -drive file=suspicious_floppy_v1.0.img,index=0,if=floppy
```

unobfuscated code in `TMP.dat`
-> 8086 code

subleq code starts at TMP.dat+0x266
size 23386


(r0) base + 0 -> ??
(r1) base + 2 -> ??
(r2) base + 4 -> char_to_print
(r3) base + 6 -> retcode
(r4) base + 8 -> trigger int10h
base + 10 -> code_start

self modified code starts at 0xfea
index for it is 0x0xbb8

one char adds 1147 insn to the inner VM

# Conclusion notes

Another year of fun challenges. Thank you to {% include icon-twitter.html username="@0xcpu" %},
{% include icon-twitter.html username="@daubsi" %} and {% include icon-twitter.html username="@GradiusX" %} for keeping me on track, you've helped me not waste time on unimportant stuff.

Admittedly this edition was tough, but I learnt tons along the way. Reading the official writeup, it appears that (only?) 114 people made it to the end, out of the 3374 who scored at least one flag. And reading this:

> We plan to reduce the difficulty next year, so it may be that the 114 people who solved this yearâ€™s challenge solved not only the most difficult Flare-On to date, but the most difficult Flare-On there ever will be.

Kindda made me happy about next year's edition (why not a 3rd level on VM inception?!?)

And if I were to tell my next year's self some advices before entering the game, it would be:

 - *everything* can be solved statically
 - **always reverse everything**: don't leave anything out
 - don't make (too much) assumptions
 - difficulty increases progressively, but some "high number" challenges are easy, so don't
   overthink too much

Thank you [FireEye](), and especially the whole [FlareOn team]() for those imaginative challenges.
You've deprived me of many sleep hours, and turned them into moments of pure fun which reminds me
why I love reversing.

See you in 11 months for FlareOn 6, I'll be there!
