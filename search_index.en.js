life gives you eggs for free, you just need to spend some time making an omelet. That’s exactly what happened to me on a recent engagement for a client: a typical PHP webapp full of holes left me with a nice stable shell access.\nBut at that point I was stuck: I had a limited account (www) on this FreeBSD 9.1 (almost) up-to-date box, and interestingly  the privilege separation was done correctly enough to prevent me from getting root access simply by abusing the usual suspects (weak FS permission, setuid bins, privileged scripts and the likes).\nSo it was with little hope I decided to take a look at the recent advisories for FreeBSD which I really like because they are well maintained. One title struck my eye immediately: SA-13:06.mmap - Privilege escalation via mmap, published the day right before!\nI decided to look into it at first with not much hope, thinking the exploit would be crazy hard to trigger and heavily deep inside FreeBSD kernel. The description was actually (on purpose?) quite generic\n\nDue to insufficient permission checks in the virtual memory system, a tracing process (such as a debugger) may be able to modify portions of the traced process’s address space to which the traced process itself does not have write access.\n\nBut the patch gave me a better idea of the issue:\n\nIt kindda gave a good pointer of where to start: the usual rule for setuid dictates that a write access should immediately imply losing the elevated privilege. But this is where the bug was: by mmap a setuid binary (which any user can do), I can then choose to ptrace the process, and use PT_WRITE command to overwrite the mmap-ed memory, effectively overwriting the setuid binary!\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        I was in a rush, so my exploit is partially destructive as I overwrite directly the setuid binary. If you choose to use it, please make a copy to be able to restore it.\n\n        \n\nMy exploit was in 4 parts:\n\n\nmmap the target binary (here I chose /sbin/ping)\n\n\n\nfork to passe to be the mmap-ed address to a process I can attach to using ptrace()\n\n\nin the parent process, I attach to the child process and then prepare a basic payload to substitute the original code with\n\n\n\nall done, we could now copy our payload 1 DWORD at a time using ptrace(PT_WRITE_D)\n\n\n\nDone! Simply execute the target binary to get a root shell.\n\nBy nature, this exploit is very stable and I was able to report that I had root access to my customer :)\nI was undeniably lucky to find exactly the privilege escalation I need just exactly when I needed it (kudos to Konstantin Belousov &amp; Alan Cox for the finding), but it also taught me that there can be a huge difference of postponing applying patches, even if for one day…\nCheers mates!\nPS: for the full quick’n dirty exploit\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2013-06-20-i-feel-lucky/","title":"I feel lucky - or why I wrote a FreeBSD 1-day in one day"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2013-12-23-read-write-process-memory-on-linux/":{"body":"Even though well known methods exist to bypass ptrace deactivation on a process when spawning (fake ptrace() preloading, breakpoint on ptrace(), etc… ), it is trickier when process is already protected.\nThankfully Linux 3.2+ was generous enough to provide read/write capabilities to another process with 2 new system calls: sys_process_vm_readv and sys_process_vm_writev. (see the source code). For our Windows friend, those new syscalls are similar to ReadProcessMemory() and WriteProcessMemory().\nThe manual says:\n\nThese system calls transfer data between the address space of the calling process  (“the  local  process”) and the process identified by pid (“the remote process”).  The data moves directly  between  the address spaces of the two processes, without passing through kernel space.\n\nA running process can be ptraced like this:\n\nAs such, it would acquire an exclusive lock, preventing any other ptrace instance (say a debugger) to manipulate its memory (that’s like ELF anti-debug 101). But it can hence still have its memory read:\n\nSimilar call to process_vm_writev will tamper remote process memory.\nEven though it is not possible to read/write in process memory that don’t have the same level of privilege (unless given CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability), it is a very reliable way to leak or inject data.\nI’ve added the syscall filtering to my toy sandboxing tool, bakassabl.\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2013-12-23-read-write-process-memory-on-linux/","title":"Using new syscalls for read/write arbitrary memory on Linux."},"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-07-bkpctf-2016-simple-calc-writeup/":{"body":"Info\n\nVulnerability\nsimple_calc offered a binary that expects us to make some calculations.

What is worth noticing is that\nboth operands and result are stored in the .bss (therefore at predictable\naddresses).\n\nBy exiting, simple_calc performs a memcpy() of the malloc-ed buffer (whose\nlength is controlled by us) into a stack buffer (of length 0x28 bytes) located\nat $rbp+40h.\n\n\n\nIt is then easy to spot the trivial stack buffer overflow.\nExploitation\nWhen an operation is finished, the resulting DWORD is stored inside the malloc-ed\nbuffer at the offset corresponding of the main loop iteration.\nSo the game here is to play with those (basic) arithmetic operations to\nwrite arbitrary data in the malloc-ed buffer: for example, if we want to write\n0x10001000 | 0x20002000 in our malloc-ed buffer, we would create 2 operations,\nthen perform:\n\nan ADD with op1=0x10000000 and op2=0x00001000\nan ADD with op1=0x20000000 and op2=0x00002000\nand so on\n\nBy calling successively the same arithmetic operation, say ADD (or any other),\nwe have a predictable way to populate the malloc-ed buffer.\nTo corrupt the memory we must fill the stack buffer entirely (40 bytes), so make\nat least 10 operations. The stack buffer is followed (in the memory layout) by\nvariables, so we add 24 bytes of junk (3 QWORD), another QWORD for\noverwriting the SFP, and a last to overwrite RIP.\n\nWe execute and a SIGSEGV was well caught (as seen with\ngef) :\n\n\n\nHowever, the faulty instruction is in the free() following the memcpy() and\nyet not in the return from the main function.\nfree() is trying to remove the chunk pointed by the value stored in $rdi (here\n0x4444444444444444). However, a quick look in the man page (man 3 free) and we\nfind our solution:\n\nThe free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr,[…] If ptr is\nNULL, no operation is performed.\n\nSo let’s rebuild our stack accordingly:\n\nWe try again, and we hit the SIGSEGV in the RET. Perfect, time to bypass NX.\n\nWe want to have a shell (what else, right?) so we need all the gadgets to\nsyscall execve(‘/bin/sh’, 0, 0).\nBypassing NX is not that hard, all we need are the right gadgets. We choose a\nwritable address, and write ‘/bin//sh’ (we arbitrarily chose 0x6c3110 in the\n.bss). Using ropgadget makes\nit easier than ever:\n\nAt this stage, we have /bin//sh written @0x6c3110 and this address inside the\nEDI register. Then we can use the gadget 0x437aa9: pop rdx ; pop rsi ; ret to populate RSI and\nRDX with 0. Because it embeds a libc, the binary is full of syscall\ninstructions, we’ll use the one at 0x435675.\nWe now have our full chain:\n\nRun and pwn !\n\nThe full exploit is here.\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-07-bkpctf-2016-simple-calc-writeup/","title":"BKPCTF 2016 - Simple Calc"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-08-bkpctf-2016-complex-calc/":{"body":"The challenge is the sequel to simple_calc. If you haven’t read our write-up, now is the time 😊\nInfo\n\nVulnerability\nAt the very first look, simple_calc and complex_calc look totally\nsimilar. Both are statically compiled, same protections, the vulnerability is\nlocated at the same spot (i.e. stack overflow with a malloc-ed buffer we fully\ncontrol). Let’s do some bindiffing!\nOne of my new toys for quite a few months now is IDA Python plugin\ndiaphora by Joxean Koret (aka\n\n@matalaz\n\n). By diffing then, the issue is immediately visible:\n\n\n\nThe free() function was modified so we cannot benefit from the graceful exit\nof the function by simply passing a NULL pointer. Now, free() will always\nproceed with the address given as first parameter (therefore stored in $rdi).\nSo let’s see how free()\nworks. Some blogs already explain very well how\nGlibc heap is structured\nand how\nheap\ncorruptions\nwork. So I will assume you know as well.\nTo stand on common ground, here is what a heap chunk looks like:\n\n\n\nWhen free() is called, some checks are made to know how the chunk must be\ndeallocated:\n\nIf its size is below MMAP_THRESHOLD (default 128KB), then the chunk is\ndeallocated and inserted into the free chunk doubly linked list. The\npointers of the list are updated using the unlink macro.\nIf the size is higher than MMAP_THRESHOLD, then the chunk was not\nallocated via the brk/sbrk syscall, but mapped in memory via the\nsyscall mmap. If this heap chunk is mmap-ed, then its size will be a\nmultiple of 2 (i.e. size &amp; 2 = 2).\n\nThis actually shows quite well in the flow graph:\n\n\n\nSince we control what is written in the heap (same method than simple_calc),\nwe can control whether we want to deallocate using unlink or munmap (simply\nby or-ing the QWORD interpreter as the chunk size with 2). If we go for using\nthe regular deallocator, we need to fake our heap chunk in such a way that it will\npass all the checks performed later on. Any failure on the address will\nabort() the program, making it enable to reach the ret instruction, and\ntherefore triggering our ROP chain.\nOn the other hand, the munmap() function is actually fairly straight-forward:\n\nIf the syscall fails, it will nicely set $rax to a negative value and\nreturn back to free(), which will return (in error as well but we don’t care)\nto our main loop, which can then return nicely too and trigger our\ncode. Perfect! Let’s go with this!\nExploitation\nSo we are going to use the arithmetic operators and result locations in the\n.bss since they are at predictable, bearing in mind that each one of them is\nonly a DWORD (whereas we are here on x86-64 architecture). We will want to set\nthe following mapping:\n\nWe will point the $rdi used by the free() call pointing to div_result. But\nnow which value should we use then for operator_1 and operator_2 ?\nLet’s go back to free() flow graph:\n\n\n\nAs we see, several conditions must be filled:\n\nchunk_size = div_operator_2 | div_operator_1 (and must be divisible by 2).\nprev_size  = dword_padding  | add_result\n0x0fff &amp; ((@prev_size-prev_size) | (prev_size+size&amp;0xfff...ff8)) == 0\n\nIf we passed those checks, $rcx will have the address to munmap(), and $rsi\nthe range to deallocate. add_result is at 0x6C4A88 so we must ensure the three\nlast nibbles end with 0xa88 to nullify the substration. We decide to store in\nadd_result the value 0x0x11111a88 as the addition of 0x11110a88 and 0x1000\n\nNow that we have prev_size, we can make up a value for size too. But here is\nthe trick, the value of size will end in $rdi when munmap syscall will\nhappen. If we point to a valid address, it will be unmapped and our exploit will\nfail. So to be safe, we will use a huge valid and let the kernel throw us away\n:) Here we used 0x7fffdeaa0000.\nsize = 0x7fffdeaa0000 - 0x11111a88 = 0x9ffffeee578\nSplitting the result into 2 DWORD and we have div_operator_1=0xfffeee578 and\ndiv_operator_2=0x9f.\n\nThe rest of the exploit is exactly similar to the one used for simple_calc!\nFire up!\n\nAnd we get BKPCTF{th3 l4st 1 2 3z}\nThe full exploit is here.\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-08-bkpctf-2016-complex-calc/","title":"BKPCTF 2016 - Complex Calc"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-14-0ctf-2016-warmup-write-up/":{"body":"I participated to 0ctf but only had time to play for\nthe reversing challenge trace (write-up coming up soon) during the competition\ntime.\nI did this challenge only for fun after the CTF was over so I do not know the\nflag, and since I found it interesting, I decided to write a quick write-up.\nAnd kudos to all teams who solved it !\nInfo\n\nPretty stripped down file, very small (which seemed weird for a statically\nlinked file). Stack canary and PIE are not on, but NX is.\nVulnerability\nThe binary is really small, does not do much either, so the vulnerability is\nquite easy to find and trigger.\n\n\n\nAt 0x08048174, We have a read(socket, buffer, 52) where buffer can only\ncontain 32 bytes, so we have a classic stack overflow.

We have to go all the way to open, read, write back the value of the flag\nlocated in /home/warmup/flag.\nThis lead to a much funkier way to exploit.\nObjective\nThe objective here seems pretty straight forward. We need to :\n\nWrite /tmp/flag in a predictable and writable location ( anywhere in the\n.data section will do just fine).\nForge a sys_open(flag, RWX) gadget\nForge a sys_read(fd, another_writeable_location, 50) gadget\nForge a sys_write(socket, another_writeable_location, 50)\n\nAnd it is done! In theory it seems pretty easy, but it took me a few hours\n(never underestimate a challenge ☺).\nInteresting gadgets\nWhat the binary provides us with are gadgets to read and write:\n\nWhere the arguments are read from the limited stack we control.\nHowever, we do not have an sys_open gadget, but since we can control ebx\nfrom the stack, all we need is to find a way to set eax to\n5\nMy original intention was to force a call to sys_read from our socket, and\nsend 5 bytes of junk data so that the syscall can return with the right value in\neax. Unfortunately, we do not have enough space in our stack to chain correctly our\nread arguments, then jump into it and finally jump back to our next gadget ☹ .\nAfter quite some time, I realized that warmup starts by initializing an alarm\nfor 10 seconds (which when SIGALRM is received, will kill the\nprogram).\n\nNevertheless, this could be valuable to us, because RTFM:\n\n\n\nThat means that if we jump a second time into the gadget @0x0804810D (i.e. call\nalarm() a second time), eax will be populated with whatever time is left\nbefore SIGALRM is issued!\nAnd since alarm() can take any integer as argument, our syscall will not\nreturn as an error! So by sleeping 5 seconds, sys_alarm will return with eax\nset to NR_sys_open (5), and we can use the stack to populate the other\nregisters required for sys_open!\nAttack\nAgain, because of our limited space in the stack, we need to trigger the\nvulnerability multiple times. To do, we have to perform only one operation, then\nreturn to the original function (0x0804815A), and let the control flow repeat\nagain until it re-hit our vulnerability.\nSo let’s go back to the steps we set in the Objective part for the\nexploitation part:\nWriting /tmp/flag in a predictable and writable location can be done with the\nfollowing gadgets:\n\nNow we have to sleep !! ☺\n\nNow we can send our second payload, to call alarm, setting eax to\nNR_sys_open, and append the other arguments:\n\nWe have now a file descriptor open to our flag file!

During the competition,\nonly 18 teams (out of the 500+) were able to solve it. All props to them!\nThe technique I used to solve it is a bit twisted but it works fine and\nreliably. So hang on ☺\nInfo\n\nSince the target is an ARM binary, I heavily relied on the tool I wrote,\nGDB-GEF to help me in the exploitation process.\nVulnerability\nruin is an ARM ELF binary that allows you to store “securely” messages in\nmemory, acting like a safe.\nThe real main() function starts at 0x00008A88 and starts by allocating on the\nheap (malloc()) an 8-byte chunk, then jump\nto a function at 0x89CC (which I’ve called get_key_security) to authenticate\nand unlock the safe.\n\n\n\nThe strncmp() call trivially shows the expected initial key, in this case\nsecurity. Once the safe is unlocked, 4 different operations are possible:\n\nUpdate the key (function @0x000087D0, which I will call update_key() in\nthe rest of this write-up): this function will allocate a\n16-byte key chunk, and copy the content from stdin.\nEdit a secret stored (function @0x0000884C,  which I will call\nedit_secret()): if the secret chunk is\nnot allocated, then the function invokes malloc(8). Then it performs an\nfgets() to store 24 bytes from stdin (us!) into this buffer. We immediately\nspot a heap overflow here.\n\n\n\nSign the secret with your name (function @0x000088B8, sign_name()): if the name chunk\nis not NULL (i.e. already allocated), then the function returns. Otherwise,\nit calls the read_int() function at 0x0875C which prompts the user for the\nname size with atoi(), checks it’s higher than 0x20 bytes, if\nso, malloc(size) and reads its contents from stdin using fgets().\n\n\n\nLeave (function @0x00008978, leave()): invokes free() to de-allocate the 3\nbuffers allocated by the steps above, and then exit cleanly.\n\nWe have 2 vulnerabilities here:\n\nThe heap overflow explained in the edit_secret() function\nThe integer overflow from the sign_name() function, since the atoi()\ncall is not checked for negative integer before being compared. This allows\nus to control the size of the next malloc() call (the one used to store the\nname).\n\nExploitation\nThe House of Force\nWith those 2 vulnerabilities, and the fact that we can control another chunk to\nbe allocated (through the update_key() function), we have now a perfect\nscenario for an “House of Force” heap exploitation. If you need a reminder, I\nrecommend you read this and\nthis.\nThe idea behind this attack (which still works against recent libc heap\nallocator), is to be able to control the size of one chunk. By making the value\nof the size for this new chunk very big, it will allow us to overflow the\naddress space, and make the chunk upper bound finish in an “interesting” writable\nlocation, for example, the\nGlobal Offset Table.\nWhen we reach the “main” loop, the secret chunk (8 bytes) is already\nallocated. So we can use the malloc(name_size) to create a chunk that will\noverflow the address space and end in the GOT, which starts at 0x00010F48.\n\nSo what size do we need for the name chunk? We know that the key chunk can\nwrite 16 bytes, so 4 DWORD. And also, the target address must be aligned to 2\nDWORD (8 bytes - because it is an ARM 32 bits).\n\n\nLeaking heap memory\nBut we have a problem, we don’t know where the heap pages are located in the memory\nfread(), which unlike\nfgets() does not append a NULL byte at the end of the string.\n\n\n\nThis allows to leak addresses some precious bytes from the heap, doing something like this:\n\nControlling $pc\nFrom the heap memory leak, we know the address of the secret chunk, which\nmeans that the name chunk headers will be located exactly 8 bytes after.\n\nSo we must set the length for the name chunk dynamically by using the\nupdate_key() function:\n\nThe heap is now set dynamically with the correct offset. The next call to\nmalloc() will overwrite the GOT entry of atoi@got with our data!\n\nWhich produces the following result in gef:\n\n\n\nBingo! We control the execution flow! Good! But now where do we go?\nThe binary is dynamically linked, and does not contains any gadget that would\nallow us to call directly execve so we need a leak from the libc.\nUsing function indirection to leak memory using printf\nI’m not sure if this is the best way to do, but I like this approach: the idea\nis that, when you can overwrite the GOT, point an “interesting” function of the\ncontrol flow to printf@plt. This way, if you can control the parameter of this\ncall, you can use a regular format string attack to read/write everywhere!!\nThe read_int() (at 0x875c) offers a perfect exploitation case:\n\n\n\nfgets at 0x878c allows us to provide 32 bytes in the stack, which will be\ngiven to atoi as a parameter. So if we overwrite atoi@got with the address\nof printf@plt, we have a good case for a format string attack.\nSo using the technique above, we can overwrite atoi@got with the address of\nprintf in the PLT:\n\n\nSo now every time the control flow will hit the atoi() function, the printf()\nstub will be executed, and we will receive the argument from the socket! So\nevery time the banner will prompt for a choice (1-4), the buffer we send will be\nthe argument to printf().\nTriggering the exploit\nBy leaking the memory, we find that an address to the libc can be found (at\nleast) at the offset 21:\n\n\n\nOn the C library I tested, the system() function was located at an offset of\n0x37524 from the base. So now, we know the address of system():\n\nAnd to complete the exploitation, all we must do is overwrite again atoi@got\nwith the address of system(), and when fgets() will be triggered, simply\nenter the command we want to execute, in this case /bin/sh will do:\n\nThe exploit is complete, we can run it:\n\n\n\nAnd as always, go here for\nthe full exploit.\nPeace out ✌\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-22-bctf-16-ruin/","title":" BCTF 2016 - Ruin"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2016-03-28-volgactf-2016-web-of-science/":{"body":"Info\n\nIt’s a simple dynamically linked binary for x86-64.

So\nthe idea for this exploitation is to brute-force one-by-one all the bytes from the\ncanary variable in stack, with the following binary logic: overwrite one byte of\nthe canary with a value, X. If we have a crash, it will mean that the canary is\ncorrupted, and therefore X is not valid. If it does not crash, then X is\nvalid, and we can reproduce this action with the following canary byte\n(this is very analog to the exploitation of a colour-blind SQL\ninjection exploitation).\nSo we have this buffer:\n\nIf we attempt to corrupt the first byte of the canary with a wrong value, our\nprocess will be killed immediately and we will receive the message (“Child exit”):\n\nBut when the value for the byte is valid, the program will continue its\nexecution at 0x080490DF and display a message (“YUM, got…”).\n\nSo leaking one byte can be summed with the following Python code:\n\nOnce we have the value of the first byte, we resume the same operation with the\n2nd and so on, until having the 4 bytes forming the canary.\n\nWe know control the execution flow without triggering the canary_fail()\nfunction.

This means that we can provide negative-sized buffer:\n\nWhich we confirm immediately in IDA:\n\nThis is an issue because the free_buffer(data_ptr) assumes that it will find the\nlength of the chunk at data_ptr - 8 and use this location to store a pointer\nto the head_free_list_ptr.

I had recently spent some time adding new features and perfectionning old ones to\nmy exploit helper for GDB, gef and I saw\nthere a perfect practice case. On top of that, I had nothing better to do\nyesterday ☺\nThis challenge was really fun, and made so much easier thanks to gef especially to\ndefeat real life protections (NX/ASLR/PIC/Canary), and on a non-x86 architecture (Intel is so\n’90). This is mostly why I’m doing this write-up, but feel curious and try it by\nyourself. Fun time ahead  ☺\n5aelo suggests a few\napproaches to tackle it, I decided to go “Total Pwn”, meaning discovering\neverything about the binary. There is also links to Qemu images ready-to-use,\nfor people who don’t have (or don’t want to use) a RPI.\nChallenge:\nTry to go from anonymous access to remote code execution on the websrv process\nrunning on a Raspberry-Pi rpi2-1:80.\n\nLet’s get it started!\nNote: since a solution to the challenge is available within the GitHub\nrepo, I don’t feel too bad publishing my own.\nWeb Application attack\nJust like for a regular pentest, all we know here is that the port 80/tcp is open,\nand accessing to / redirect us to a page to turn on and off a LED (supposed\nconnected to the GPIO on our RaspberryPi). Not exactly fancy…\nBy sending a simple ncat request, things get suddenly more interesting:\n\n\n\nHint: Other tools were tested and failed. The reason for that is that they\nparse and resolve the URL before sending it. So if I try to fuzz\nhttp://foo/../../../another/path, the tools will automatically solve it as\nhttp://foo/another/path even before the request leaves my computer. This is\n(IMHO) a bad feature for pentesters/bug hunters as it may lead to missing out some easy\nvulns (just like here!). So again, only one rule apply: trust only your own\ntools!\nBack to business: we can now read files remotely like /etc/passwd but we can\nalso retrieve the binary using /proc/self/exe\n\nMuch better, we have the binary to analyze! This part was pretty\nstraight-forward, let’s move on.\nNext, the binary analysis.\nReversing the binary\nWe can use IDA to start with the static analysis. After a quick examination,\nthe overall structure reveals itself quite clearly.\nThe behaviour for the main process can be described with this pseudo-code:\n\nThe use of fork() is a good news as we know that we will be able to reuse\nany address we leaked.\nThe forked process which executes treat_requests() is more interesting: the\nfunction starts by reading 0x800 bytes and\nlook for the marker of end for HTTP headers (CRLF*2).  If not found, it will\nkeep iterating through the loop. Otherwise, the block read will search for the header Content-Length and if\nfound, will call strtol() on it to convert the pointer into a long\ninteger (let’s call it N).\n\n\n\nThis value will be used to call read N bytes from\nthe socket and stored in local buffer of size 0xffc. The overflow comes clear as\nwe controlled the size of the Content-Length header, we can forged an HTTP\nrequest whose body is big enough to corrupt the memory.\n\nThis is quite easy to PoC, simply by sending a large buffer:\n\nRun it and see the crash.\n\nAnd checking at our process, we can see:\n\nSo (at least) one of the vulnerabilities is a standard stack overflow. We can\nconfirm that by visualizing the execution flow with GDB debugger with gef\nextension with trace-run.\n\nBy using the\nida_color_gdb_trace.py\nscript, we can visualize in IDA the execution flow, that confirms our PoC and\nhighlights all the addresses in $pc executed.\n\n\n\nUsing the pattern commands of gef we find out that we start overwriting the\ncanary after sending 4042 bytes.\nExploitation\nBinary protections\nEven though we have a memory corruption, this is not enough since we have plenty\nof protection mechanism to defeat first ☹\n\nAnd on top of all those, ASLR is on. Given the target is 32 bits, brute-force is a\nrealistic approach, although inelegant. One (or more) memory leak(s) can defeat\nPIC &amp; ASLR, let’s look for those first.\nFortunately, thanks to the Step-1 (Web Application attack), we know that we can dump the memory layout of\nthe process (by reading the /proc/self/maps), and also download a copy of the\nlibc so we can call execve().\nNote: the stack is actually RWX but I chose not to use that.\n\nSo we have execve_addr = libc_base + 0x9bf80 and also `binsh_str = libc_base\n\n0x119f08. We can build the call execve(‘/bin/sh’, 0, 0)`.\n\nLeaking the canary\nLast thing we need to build a full exploit is a way to leak/brute-force the\ncanary.\nIn the pseudo-code earlier, we found that the main process was calling a\nfunction that we named treat_requests(). IDA shows us that this function is\nactually a loop to process one or more valid HTTP requests on the same socket.\n\n\n\nWhich looks something like:\n\nThis gives us a perfect way to leak the canary:\n\ntry to brute-force byte 0 of the canary, and then send another valid\n(dummy) HTTP request.\nif the byte tested is incorrect (i.e. different from the canary), the\nprocess will die, closing the socket, that we can detect on our end by an\nEOFError.\notherwise, the byte 0 is valid, proceed with byte 1\n\nIterating using this method for the 4 bytes allows us to leak the canary:\n\nBuilding the ROP sequence\nAlmost there! We have bypassed ASLR, PIC, NX and SSP. In x86, we would be just\ndone. ARM however uses one register (saved on stack) to save the return address\n(called the Link Register) along with all the non-volatile registers that must\nbe preserved across functions calls.\nIDA shows that the parse_request() function finishes its execution by\nrestoring the context of the calling function:\n\nAs we can see $pc is restored from the stack right after some registers. Since\neverything is in the stack on which we have total control over, when we\ncall execve(), the execution flow would expected that the pointer to our\nstring to execute be in $r0 as per ARM calling convention. So we need an extra\ngadgets to pop the /bin/sh address directly into $r0. gef module ropgadget\nwill work perfectly for this. Finding suitable gadgets is a little harder on ARM\nthan x86 as you find hardly instructions to pop directly into your argument\nregisters (for example pop{r0}, or pop{r1}) So you’ll need to chain them\nadequately, bearing in mind which registers will be affected the gadgets (for\nexample blx will also affect the Link Register which may be indesirable).\nBuilding the ROP sequence for this binary is not hard, so I built a helper\nfunction:\n\nWhich makes the final payload quite clear:\n\nYou may notice that I also call dup2() thrice to redirect stdin/stdout/stderr\ndirectly to the socket (which presumably holds the file description #4).\nNow run it, enjoy the shell and a good coffee ☕\n\n\n\nThe complete exploit code can be found\nhere.\nFinal notes\nThanks to \n@5aelo\n\n for this fun\nchallenge.

This research has led to a\nblog post available on elttam R&amp;D blog. Among\nmany other things, I’ve found that canaries built with recent glibc may have\ntheir values leaked, should the program be also vulnerable to an arbitrary file\nread access, and if it exposes its\nAuxiliary Vector via\nthe procfs structure.\nAll the details regarding the following attack on the canary are explained in\nthis blog post, so I will assume that you are familiar with it. If you’re not:\n\nthe full article is here\nthe code repository is there\n\nIn the article, I imagined the attack scenario would apply perfectly well to a\nWeb or FTP server, and would occur following those steps:\n\ndump /proc/self/auxv to get the AT_RANDOM location\nread /proc/self/mem and force an lseek access to reach the location found\nabove via\nthe HTTP header Range (for\ninstance Range: bytes=&lt;0xAT_RANDOM_LOCATION&gt;-&lt;0xAT_RANDOM_LOCATION+16&gt;)\nTruncate the received buffer to sizeof(register)\nNullify the last byte (result &amp;= ~0xff)\n\nThat was the theory, which made perfect sense, but I wanted a practice\ncase.\nEarlier this year, I had some fun with ARMPWN, a vulnerable web server\ncreated by  \n@5aelo\n\n to practice\nexploitation on ARM, so I have decided to use it for a practical, yet very\nrealistic exploit case.\nYou can download:\n\nthe new websrv.c here\nor simply the patch here\n\nPatch analysis\nThis cheap patch provides to the “new” websrv the (pseudo-)capability to\nparse the HTTP Range header\nprovided by the client. This is basically how modern Web servers (Apache, nginx)\ntreat this header.\n\nIn the earlier exploit, we had exploited the Directory Traversal to dump the\nprocess memory mapping (via /proc/self/maps) and defeat PIE &amp; ASLR. To crush\nSSP protection, we managed to get the canary value by brute-forcing it, which is\nvery noisy (the canary can be found in max. of 4*256=1024 HTTP requests on a\n32-bit architecture, 2048 on 64-bit) and risky (the memory corruption may alert\nof an on-going attack).\nBut now we can actually do much better: we have all the conditions\nmentioned earlier to exfiltrate the canary’s value, thanks to the ELF Auxiliary\nVector.\nExploitation\nThis approach is a lot more stable and stealthier than canary brute-forcing,\nsince we don’t rely on any memory corruption/process crash to determine the\nvalid bytes of the canary\nas we did before.\nFind AT_RANDOM from the Auxiliary Vector\nSo first, we need to read the process Auxiliary Vector exposed via procfs.\n\nAnd then parse the result:\n\nIf we did things correctly, this will store in the variable at_random_address\nthe address of the 16 random bytes provided by the kernel, used to create the\ncanary.\n(l)seeking the process memory via the HTTP Range header\nSince procfs also exposes the process memory, we can use /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/mem to\nseek to the address we’ve found at the step above.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Warning\n    \n        \n        yama/ptrace_scope must be set to 0 to be able to read the process\nmemory.\n\n        \n\nFire!\nThe final exploitation script which combines all the steps described above can\nbe found here.\n\nTo be we fetched the correct value for the canary of the remote process, we can use this script locally to compare the values for the canary:\n\n\nConclusion\nThis exploitation shows a different way to leak the canary value, and therefore defeat the SSP protection. As you may have noticed, since this attack does not rely on memory corruption, it is extremely reliable. And it is also much faster: the canary brute-force can take up 4x256 (or resp. 8x256 for 64-bits) requests to determine, where this approach found the same value with only 2 requests.\nThis illustrates once again the need to maintain a system as hardened as possible, especially on production systems, since restricting ptrace, or refusing to expose AUXV like GrSec does, would defeat this attack.\nThanks for reading, and as usual drop me a line on IRC/Twitter/email for any question/comment ☕\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-01-24-armpwn-redux-canary-reloaded/","title":"ARMPWN redux: canary reloaded"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-01-26-insomni-hack-ctf-2017-bender-safe/":{"body":"Insomni’Hack CTF 2017 offered a series of 3\nchallenges (i.e. 3 different flags) on the same binary, called bender_safe:\n\nbender_safe was a Reversing challenge (50 pts) to discover the correct\nvalidation sequence;\nbender_safer (this one) was a Pwnable challenge (300 pts), which could only be done once\nthe first challenge was solved;\nbender_safest was a Shellcoding challenge (150 pts), which could only be\nreached done when the two challenges above were solved. The goal was to\nwrite a MIPS shellcode to establish a connection to the local port tcp/31337.\n\nClose to the end, only 19 teams (out of 400+) had solved this challenge. I\nfinished this challenge after the CTF, and since there was no write-up\navailable, I chose to write one.\nInfo\nThe vulnerable file bender_safe is a 32-bit MIPS (Big-Endian) binary.\n\nNo major protection, but I assumed ASLR active and therefore randomizing\nthe stack (only the stack, as the binary is not PIE).\nIn addition, some regions were RWX:\n\nVulnerability\nThe binary execution starts where the challenge bender_safe left off, with the\nOTP validation. We then get into a simple menu offering 3 choices:\n\nwhich we can immediately spot in IDA with the function enter_vault. IDA also\ngives us a clear indication of the stack layout:\n\nThe passwords variable is a 1028 (0x410-0xC) byte array, which is used to\nstore the passwords. When trying to populate the array (choice #2), the function\ninit_passwords will be hit, and prompt the user for the number of passwords to\nstore, which must be an integer strictly below 513. enter_vault will\nstore the number of passwords to store in 2 locations, a dedicated variable\n(@ebp-0x414), but also as the first value of the array passwords\n(i.e. passwords[0], @ebp-0x410). The number of passwords is used as a counter for a loop\nthat will read the passwords from stdin, thanks to the read_passwords function.\n\n\n\nAfter spending way too long spent trying to check for an arithmetic mistake, I\nreviewed more thoroughly the function read_passwords.\nThe function read_passwords takes two arguments, a pointer to a buffer and a\ninteger, which corresponds to the size of data to read. The buffer is populated\none character at a time, in the following loop:\n\n\n\nThe interesting bit starts around 0x401640: when a \\n character is provided to\nfill the byte at offset i (i.e. buffer[i]), the function performs an additional\ncheck to test if the preceding character (i.e. buffer[i-1]) was\n\\r and if so replace it with \\n. And the vulnerability (as subtle as it is)\nis here: when overwriting the byte, the function does not check that\ni&gt;0. Because we are on big endian architecture, this can lead to size\noverwrite. To do so, we need to\n\nSpecify a number of passwords of ord('\\r') (or 13);\nThe application will reply that we can store 13 passwords of 76 bytes;\nEnter a first password with only \\n\n\nThis will overwrite the number of passwords stored in passwords[0] to 10,\nallowing us to write 12 passwords of 102 bytes (i.e. 1224 bytes), which results\nin a stack overflow.\nThe vulnerability can  be asserted by setting a breakpoint before and after\nthe first call to read_passwords.\n\nAnd if we populate the 12 remaining passwords with “A”*102 the return address\n($ra register) gets corrupted, which we can observe by taking the exit:\n\n\nExploitation\nControlling $pc\nSo we are now able to make the program crash. To know the exact offset of $pc,\nI’ve used the De Bruijn pattern from gef and pwntools.\n\nAnd we now know that the PC is controlled at offset 921, as we are on a Big\nEndian architecture:\n\n\nROP-ing to a fixed area\nSo great, we can control $ra, and therefore call any location. But the MIPS ABI\nuses registers (from $a0 to $a3) to store parameters of function\ncalls so we need to control (at least some of) them.\nTo achieve code execution, I decided to reach control only of $a0 and $a1,\nwhich is then sufficient to call read_passwords(buffer, length), and have a\nshellcode copied into one of the fixed RWX location.\nAfter seeing too many ROP tools for MIPS fail, I simply used objdump -D to\nfind the following gadgets:\n\n0x00403ba4: Control $s2 from a value given from the stack\n\n\n\n0x403bbc: Use $s2 to control $v0\n\n\n\n0x00403b98: Use $v0 to control $a0\n\n\n\nBy re-using gadget@0x00403ba4 with 0x004038e8, we use $s2 to control $a1\n\n\nWe can chain those 4 gadgets to entirely control $a0 and $a1 and then call\nread_passwords to write a execve('/bin/sh') shellcode into one of fixed RWX pages (I’ve\nchosen 0x004a8a00).\n\nShellcode crafting\nFor some reasons, the different shellcodes I had from external resources did not\nwork. So I decided to use Keystone Engine to\nwrite one. Instead of writing totally from scratch, I used a template created\nearlier as part of my project\ncemu\nand adapted it:\n\n\nUpdate: as \n@0xGrimmlin](https://twitter.com/0xGrimmlin) [mentioned\n\n, during the CTF,\nthe challenge was actually QEMU chroot-ed, so technically this shellcode would\nnot have worked, but you could similarly build another one doing\nopen/read/write(stdout)\n\nFire\nWe have now all the components to launch our exploit.

If you haven’t checked it out, make sure you add this on your to-read list.\nI have been initially developing gef for the same reason, to learn more about non-x86 architectures. So in the same spirit of openness that Azeria has shown, I am releasing a few Qemu virtual machines to start immediately playing with ARM, MIPS, PowerPC and AARCH64 architectures!\nAll you need is Qemu. Then download the link to your image, and unzip the archive.\nIf you are on Linux/OSX, run in a terminal (or double-click) on the ./start.sh script, when our Windows friend would simply need to double-click the ./start.bat.\nEach VM will also TCP forward its SSH port for easy interaction. On Linux/OSX, just run ./ssh.sh. Windows users will need tools like PuTTY.\nThose images are battery-included, development tools, compilation and debugging tools too. Ever wondered what SPARC assembly looks like? Always feeling itchy to learn about memory corruption on PowerPC? Wait no more!\nLinks\nWithout further ado:\n\nLink to Mega.nz\nLink to Google Drive\n\nUnless stated otherwise, root password is root, and an low privilege account called user is created.\n\nUpdate: the current ARMv6 image is based on a Raspberry Pi image. Therefore, the username is pi , password raspberry and is sudoer NOPASSWD. I will update the image soon to fix this.\n\n\n\nBut why ?\nAlready existing fantastic projects such as Vagrant for Linux/*nix and modern.ie for Windows help us getting quickly functional environments we can use in labs. But they are only providing Intel-based images.\nThe closest thing to what I wanted when I started exploring exotic architectures was aurel32 (now Debian Quick Image Baker) Qemu pages, which provides great Qemu images. Unfortunately, they are using extremely old kernels and/or Linux distributions, making it too hard for a quick plug-n-play experience.\nInterestingly when developing gef, I talked with many people interested in learning about non-x86 architectures but felt like they don’t know where to start. So my hope is that those images will be the start to a lot of fun.\nAll the VMs come with 2 compiled ELF binaries: a very simple hello-world to start easy with the new architecture, run it, start gdb-ing around it to understand the architecture basics (memory layout, function call convention, GOT+PLT, stack canary, etc.) and a simple-bof, which is a simple Stack Overflow ELF to start on the way of understanding memory corruption.\nBut I just wanna play with assembly…\nSo take a look at this.\nOk so what’s next ?\nWell, those VMs were built from scratch using Qemu, which takes forever. I will add some more VMs on other arch soon (MIPS64, S390x, etc.), but if you like that, simply drop me a line on Twitter, to keep me boosted.\nHope you’ll enjoy it!\n\n\n\nOh and if you happen to be wandering in Black Hat Las Vegas 2017, come say hi at the Black Hat Arsenal booth\nCheers!\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-06-25-qemu-images-to-play-with/","title":"Some Qemu images to play with"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-07-14-building-a-debian-stretch-qemu-image-for-mipsel/":{"body":"Building a Debian Stretch (9) QEMU image running MIPSel\n\nTL;DR\nTwo new images, Debian Stretch on MIPSel and MIPS64el were added to\nmy QEMU image repo\nThe rest of this post explains how I built them.\n\nIntroduction\nAfter releasing the QEMU images I’ve created to test GEF, I’ve received tons of demands from people asking for more images, but also for some DYI procedures.\nAs \n@Fox0x01\n\n, through this blog post I intend to provide a step-by-step how-to on building a Debian Stretch Malta MIPS32el image.\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        There is no miracle here, I’ve just spend a long time googling for solution every time I was facing a problem. This tuto is more for a being a personal reminder for the future times I need to build an image 😊\n\n        \n\nPre-requisites\nFor the Debian MIPS net installer, the initrd is the installation\ndevice. No need to download any ISO or such, simply download:\n\nthe initrd (the distro installer):\n\n\n\na kernel to boot on:\n\n\nYou also need a hard drive to install the OS on:\n\nSince we’re using the Debian net installer, we will need an Internet connection. Also don’t be surprised to see your CPU activity jump up and your fans get louder!\nInstalling Debian\nStart the installation with:\n\nThe kernel boot option nokaslr is required or you’ll get an error when the\nkernel will try to decompress initrd. The reason is:\n\n[…] that QEMU loads the initrd into the memory\nimmediately after the kernel, but that bit of memory might get\noverwritten by KASLR when the kernel starts and relocates itself.\nYou can workaround it by passing “-append nokaslr” to QEMU, […]\n\nSource\nThen your MIPSel (Malta-flavor) system boots, and you end up in the regular\nncurses Debian installer.\n{{ img(src=“https://i.imgur.com/IqDge4n.png” title=“1.debian.installer.png”%“) }}\nLet the installer do its magic.\n\n\n\nSince it’s a VM for test and lab stuff, the guided partitioning is more than\nenough (and select All files in one partition). Feel free to tweak that part.\n\n\n\nI usually install only the minimum OS to get a running shell once I boot. For\nthere I install everything from apt-get. With a proper openssh-server\ninstalled, I then create 2 scripts:\n\nstart.sh with all the good QEMU parameters, to launch the VM in\nnon-graphic mode, and set up the port forward on tcp/22\nssh.sh to connect to the VM.\n\nDebian will detect no boot loader, and show the following warning:\n\n\n\nSo remember to append root=/dev/sda1 to -append option before running your\nQemu.\nThen the installation will finish successfully:\n\n\n\nFixing the last quirks\nIf you try to boot directly the VM by simply removing the -initrd line, the\nkernel will panic like this:\n\nWe must extract the initrd image from the installation: to do so you must\nmounting the QEMU disk via the\nNetwork Block Device\nkernel module nbd:\n\nExtract the initramfs file (initrd.img) from MOUNT_PATH/boot/\n\nAnd unmount the NBD device.\n\nYou can now boot the VM with the following command:\n\n\n\n\nOn all the images I’ve created, Debian doesn’t properly DHCP the Ethernet\ninterface (get a wrong name for the interface), so it must be done manually at\nthe first boot (use ip -a to show the interface name):\n\nYou can now use the start.sh script to init the VM, and ssh.sh to SSH to it\nas user.\nThe start.sh usually looks like\n\nAnd the ssh.sh:\n\nFor Windows, simply convert script.sh to Batch.\nDownload the new images\nSince I’ve built in parallel a Malta MIPS32el and MIPS64el for this tutorial,\nboth have been added to the folder on Mega.nz\nThe MIPS64el was created exactly the same way, except that QEMU required the\nproper CPU version to boot correctly:\n\nThe adequate files were downloaded from\nhere, then choose your wanted version (here, Debian9.13) and go to main/installer-mips64el to download the installer files.\nA few known issues\n\n\nThe kernel doesn’t boot the initrd: from my experience on it, either your\ninitrd is incorrect, or try to append proper kernel boot options\n(-append).\n\n\nThe error WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations appears often:\nthat’s a QEMU warning from\nos_host_main_loop_wait() and\nthe code provides a good description of the issue:\n\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, I highly recommend to only use the official repo (from\ndeb.debian.org or mirrors.kernel.org). It might be a bit slower than\nyour local mirror, but mirrors do not always mirror all the\narchitectures generated by Debian maintainers.\n\nConclusion\nThat’s how you get started with making your own QEMU images. Debian, as the real\nhacker distro it is, is usually the one that works best for trying weird\ncombination, and MIPS CPUs are very well supported. More posts will come on\nbuilding other QEMU images for other ABI, which are not necessarily that easy to\nsetup.\nI hope you now have all the information to make your own QEMU images.\nThanks for reading!\n\nNote (2017-11-15): links updated\n\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-07-14-building-a-debian-stretch-qemu-image-for-mipsel/","title":"Building a Debian Stretch QEMU image for MIPSel"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-08-01-gef-at-black-hat-arsenal-us-2017/":{"body":"GEF at Black Hat Arsenal US 2017\nI had the privilege to be invited to present my tool GEF at Black Hat Arsenal organized by ToolsWatch in Las Vegas this year.\nI did prepare a bunch of things for this presentation, including a good polishing of the docs, and a series of screencasts for people new to the tool, so they can start using the best features straight away.\nYou can find the presentation slides here and the tutorial playlist on YouTube for the screencasts to start learning using it, and some of its best features.\nThank you to those who attended (especially with the collision with the lunch period ☹ ), and as usual if you have questions, feel free to reach out.\nCheers !\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-08-01-gef-at-black-hat-arsenal-us-2017/","title":"GEF at Black Hat Arsenal US 2017"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-08-07-setting-up-a-windows-vm-lab-for-kernel-debugging/":{"body":"This is the first on a series of posts on Windows kernel debugging and\nexploitation.\nIn this part, we’ll cover in details how to get everything setup using Linux as\nhost, VirtualBox as hypervisor and Windows virtual images from Modern.IE.\nNote: there is nothing ground-breaking here, those posts are mostly notes and\nreminders for the future. Other people did a fantastic job covering the same\ntopic, so you might probably be more interested into reading those 😁\nI like working on a Linux host, so using VirtualKD\nisn’t an option. So my setup is:\n\nDebian testing x64 as host\nVirtualBox as hypervisor\nA\nWindows 7 x64 VM acting\nas debugger.\nAnd 2 debuggees:\n\nWindows 7 x86 VM (using UART as debugging medium)\nWindows 8.1 x64 VM (using Network as debugging medium)\n\n\n\nAs a commodity, I’ve created a\nVagrantfile to simplify the VM\ncreation process using Vagrant. You can create a new\nWindows VM like this\n\nand go grab a coffee ☕\nPreparing the Debugger VM\nOnce the VM is created and Windows properly installed, edit the VM settings in\nVirtualBox to do the following:\n\nIn the “Serial Ports” tab, enable one port. You can use any “Port Number”\nyou want, just remember it, as you’ll need to specify it to WinDBG the\nWin7 debuggee is ready. Select Host Pipe as “Port Mode” and enter a local\npath in the “Path/Address” field (for example /tmp/win7-kd-pipe). This\npipe will be the relay VirtualBox will use to communicate between the\ndebugger and debuggee through UART. Last, make sure the “Connect to existing\npipe/socket” is unchecked.\n\n\n\n\n\nin the “Network” tab, on top of the the default NAT-ed network created by\nVirtualBox, add and enable another adapter as Host-Only. Then link it to an\nexisting interface on the host (for example vboxnet0).\n\n\n\n\nNow the debugger is ready, you need to install WinDBG as the kernel debugger. A\nquick way, is to use Chocolatey in an administrator prompt to install it\nas such:\n\nAlthough this won’t install the very latest WinDBG, this approach is convenient\nto going through downloading and installing the SDK from MS\nwebsite. Additionally, you can script it to install more tools useful for\nlater (python, ConEmu, HxD etc.)\nSetup UART debugging on the Windows 7 target\nNote: All is described\nhere.\nAll OS can be kernel-debugged via Serial Port (or UART). Although this method is\nuniversal, it is also the slowest.\nTo enable it, start the Windows 7 debuggee VM, open a cmd.exe as\nAdministrator, and add another entry to the boot loader\nusing bcdedit utility:\n\nThen enable debug mode on new entry UUID:\n\n\n\n\nNow instruct Windows serial communication as debugging medium, and use the\n“fastest” baud rate (i.e 115200 symbols/sec). Since we’ll only use serial\ndebugging for this VM, we can use the bcdedit /dbgsettings global switch.\n\nNote: if we wanted to set debug settings specific to one entry of the boot\nloader, we would’ve used bcdedit /set instead. For instance:\n\nNow, shutdown the VM and go to its settings on VirtualBox (Machine -&gt;\nSettings) and in the “Serial Ports” tab, enable one port and bind it to\nCOM1 (since we used the debugport:1 above with bcdedit), and select Host Pipe as Port Mode. Last provide a path to file in the Path/Address field, for\nexample /tmp/win7-kd-pipe.\n\n\n\nThe tickbox Connect to existing pipe/socket means that the debuggee will\nalways have to be started after the debugger VM, or VirtualBox will throw an\nerror.\nRunning the debugging session\nOn the debugger\nStart the debugger VM first and prepare WinDBG for kernel-mode debugging\n(Ctrl-K) by selecting COM as debug vector:\n\n\n\nWinDBG will then wait for communications on COM1.\n\nOn the debuggee\nStart the debuggee, and when the boot loader menu shows up, select the entry\nnamed Windows 7 with kernel debug via COM.\n\n\n\nAs you see Windows already indicates that this entry will be in debug mode. And\nwhen you press Enter, the debugger VM will be attached to the debuggee.\n\n\n\nYou’re now debugging the Windows 7 x86 VM kernel!! But as you’ll see, Serial\nPort debugging will drastically slow down all operations on the debuggee. This\nis why projects like VirtualKD came to life, but personnally, if the target VM\nis a Windows 8+, my favorite kernel debugging method is Network based, as\ndetailed below.\nSetup Network kernel debugging for the Windows 8+ target\nNote: All is described\nhere.\nIMHO, this method is the best and fastest method to debug Windows kernel, but it\nhas 2 constraints:\n\nyou must use a compatible network adapter (not so much a problem for\nVirtualBox or VMware)\nthe debuggee must be running Windows 8 or later.\n\nWhen preparing the VM, make sure to add an extra Network Card as Host-Only, and\nlinked to the same interface as the one specified on the host\n(i.e. vboxnet0). Important note: in the “Advanced” section, select one of\nthe Intel Pro card (preferably PRO/1000 MT Desktop). The reason for that is that\nWindows network kernel debugging does not work with all network controllers.\nBoot the VM, and then open the “Device Manager” (Control Panel -&gt;\nSystem -&gt; Advanced system settings -&gt; on the Hardware tab). Expand “Network\nadapters” and select the 2nd device’s properties menu. On the new window, the\n“Location” field will be required to assignate this interface for debugging:\n\n\n\nThis indicates us the bus parameters we will need to provide bcdedit later on,\nwith the format &lt;BusNumber&gt;:&lt;DeviceNumber&gt;:&lt;FunctionNumber&gt; (in this case\n0.8.0).\nNow open an administrator prompt and use bcdedit utility to create a\nnew entry to the boot manager like we did on Windows 7, and enable the debug\nmode for it. But unlike Windows 7, now we have to setup the network properties:\n\n\n\nRunning the debugging session\nOn the debugger\nStart the debugger VM first and prepare WinDBG for kernel-mode debugging\n(Ctrl-K) by selecting NET as debug vector, and set the Port and Key adequately.\nWinDBG will then be waiting for new connection:\n\nOn the debuggee\nStart the VM. When the boot loader menu shows up, select the one with the\nnetwork kernel mode enabled\n\n\n\nThe debugger will show some activity immediately. Note that execution of the\ndebuggee will not stop, so you may hit Ctrl-Break at any time to force an\ninterruption:\n\n\n\nIn this post, we’ve presented 2 techniques for kernel debugging, depending on\nthe Windows version targeted. Some other techniques exist (FireWire, USB\ndebugging) but they are slightly harder to put in place.\nThe next post will cover more of Windows kernel exploitation 101 by going\nthrough some vulnerabilities on\nthe\nHEVD driver.\nCheers ✌\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-08-07-setting-up-a-windows-vm-lab-for-kernel-debugging/","title":"Setting up a Windows VM lab for kernel debugging"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2017-08-14-a-primer-to-windows-x64-shellcoding/":{"body":"Continuing on the path to Windows kernel exploitation…\nThanks to the previous post, we now have a working lab for easily (and\nin a reasonably fast manner) debug Windows kernel.\nLet’s skip ahead for a minute and assume we control PC using some vulnerability\nin kernel land (next post), then we may want to jump back into a user allocated\nbuffer to execute a control shellcode. So where do we go from now? How to\ntransform this controlled PC in the kernel-land into a privileged process in\nuser-land?\nThe classic technique is to steal the System process token and copy it into the\nstructure of our targeted arbitrary (but unprivileged) process (say cmd.exe).\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        Our target here will the Modern.IE Windows 8.1 x64 we created in the previous post, that we’ll interact with using kd via Network debugging.

Using dt will provide a lot more info (here, massively\ntruncated to what interests us):\n\nAt nt!_EPROCESS.Token (+0x348) we get the process token, which holds a pointer to an\n“Executive Fast Reference” structure.\n\nIf we nullify the last nibble of the address (i.e. AND with -0xf on x64, -7 on\nx86), we end up having the System token’s address:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        the WinDBG extension !token provides a more detailed (and parsed) output. You might to refer to it instead whenever  you are analyzing tokens.\n\n        \n\nSo basically, if we create a process (say cmd.exe), and overwrite its token with the System token value we found (0xffffc0002f405590), our process will be running as System. Let’s try!\n\n\n\nWe search our process using kd:\n\nOverwrite the offset 0x348 with the SYSTEM token pointer (0xffffc0002f405590).\n\nAnd tada …\n\n\n\nNow we know how to transform any unprivileged process into a privileged one\nusing kd.\nShellcoding our way to SYSTEM\nSo the basic idea now, to reproduce the same steps that we did in the last\npart, but from our shellcode.

But first, we need to get the address of at the least one process in the\nkernel.\nThis is exactly the purpose of the routine nt!PsGetCurrentProcess, but\nsince we can’t call it directly (thank you ASLR), we can still check what is it\ndoing under the hood:\n\nmov rax, qword ptr gs:[188h] returns a pointer to an _ETHREAD structure (more\nspecifically the kernel thread (KTHREAD) nt!KiInitialThread).

Moreover, the\ndriver is well written, no obfuscation/packing in place, and the symbols\nare provided, to greatly improve the reversing process.\nHunting the vulnerability\nTalking to the HEVD driver\nAny Windows driver must  define an entry point by which Windows can load\nit. This is done with\nthe\nDriverEntry\nroutine whose signature is as follow:\n\nWinDbg confirms that immediately:\n\nBy checking this function in IDA Pro, we spot immediately that the driver\ncreates a device called \\Device\\HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver via the\nroutine\nIoCreateDevice,\nwith a DeviceType set\nas\nFILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN -\nor 0x22.\n\n\n\nThen the DriverObject gets populated with the structure members including functions\npointers, among which we find the IOCTL\nhandler, IrpDeviceIoCtlHandler. This function\ndispatches IOCTL requests done\nfrom user-land to the HEVD driver. Every IOCTL is uniquely identified by a specific code, and the handler will basically do a big switch(dwIoControlCode){...} to execute the corresponding code. IDA is capable of pulling out for us:\n\n\n\nIn this first exploitation, we want to reach the StackOverflowIoctlHandler, and\ntherefore need to send a\nDeviceIoControl() request with a code set to 0x222003.\nNote: for this initial post, we’ll focus on the stack overflow vulnerability, but future posts may\ncover the other vulnerabilities in the HEVD driver, for which we’ll only need to change the dwIoControlCode value in order to reach them.\nSo we know how to reach the driver and the targeted function, which would look\nlike (in pseudo-C):\n\nAnalyzing the vulnerability\nWe know how to reach StackOverflowIoctlHandler() from user-land, and pass in an\ncontrolled buffer of an arbitrary size. Here is the TriggerStackOverflow function translated to pseudo-C:\n\nThe code leaves no room for ambiguity about the vulnerability: we can overflow\nthe kernel stack by passing in a buffer of length &gt; 0x800 bytes. Since the\nbuffer is read directly from user-land\n(ProbeForRead)\nwe have full control over it, which simplifies greatly the exploitation.\nSo the exploit code looks clearer:\n\nAnd move on to the dynamic analysis…\nDynamic analysis\nAssuming SMEP\nis not enabled, once we control the program counter, we can\nsimply return to an known executable location in user-land, location that’ll\nhold\nthe shellcode we created in the last post.

For more info about the\nsetup, refer to the first post of this Windows Kernel exploitation series.\nRecon\nIDA to the rescue\nAfter not that much effort in IDA by tracing down the IOCTL dispatching function\ncallgraph, we spot the function TriggerArbitraryOverwrite() which can be\nreached via a IOCTL with a code of 0x22200B. The vulnerability is easy to spot:\n\n\n\nAfter checking the address we passed and printing some kernel debug messages,\nthe function copies the value dereferenced from rbx (which is the function\nparameter which we control) into the 32-bit register r11d. This value is then\nwritten at the address pointed by rdi.\nOr better summarized in assembly - rcx holds the function first argument\n(see [2] for a good reminder about calling conventions):\n\nSo as we can observe at 0x15BEF, we do have an  arbitrary write, but a partial one as we only\ncan write one DWORD at a time. No big deal, since we fully control the\ndestination location, we can write a QWORD by simply performing 2 writes at ADDR_DEST then\nADDR_DEST+4.\nThis is pretty much it for the vulnerability: classic case of an Arbitrary\nWrite (aka Write-What-Where). Although we are in kernel-land, we’ll see that the\nexploitation approach stays the same as when such situation occurs in user-land.\nWrite what ?\nSo what can we do with an Arbitrary Write?\nWell, just like in usermode, one of the most common approach is to transform\nthis situation into a code execution, which can be done by overwriting a\nwritable location in the kernel, which we’ll then force a call to.\nBy overwriting a function pointer with the location of our\nshellcode placed in userland, and then triggering this call from userland would\nbe enough to reach our goal (and of course, assuming SMEP is off).\nBut in kernel-land, this is not the only approach. Another one would be to\noverwrite the current process’ token by overwriting directly the\n_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES and for example, provide it with the SeDebugPrivilege allowing it\nto perform any further privileged operation on the system (naturally it is\nassumed here that we know the current process structure’s address - through an\ninfoleak or else). Back in 2012, \n@cesarcer\n\n  covered this very situation in his Black Hat\npresentation Easy Local Windows Kernel Exploitation.\nAlthough this second way would allow to work around SMEP, for the sake of\nthis post we’ll go with the first approach as it is the most commonly used.\nWrite where ?\nThe kernel has plenty of function pointer arrays that we could\nuse for our purpose. One of the first we could think of would be the system calls table. The\nSystem Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) is usually known for being hooked, as\nthis table contains the service tables in use when processing system calls. In\nKD, we can reach it at with the following symbol: nt!KeServiceDescriptorTable\n\nI’ve actually decided to use another way described very well on Xst3nZ’s blog, by overwriting the HalDispatchTable. The reason this table is particularly interesting, is that it can be fetched from userland by mapping ntoskrnl.exe and using GetProcAddr(\"HalDispatch\") to know its offset. As a result, we’ll have a much more portable exploit code (rather than hardcoding the offset by hand).\nBut why HalDispatchTable in particular? Because we can call from userland the undocumented\nfunction NtQueryIntervalProfile, that will in turn invoke nt!KeQueryIntervalProfile in the kernel, which to\nfinally perform a call instruction to the address in nt!HalDispatchTable[1]:\n\nSo if we use the WWW vulnerability to overwrite nt!HalDispatchTable[1] with\nthe address of our shellcode mapped in a RWX location in userland, then\nuse the undocumented NtQueryIntervalProfile to trigger it, we will make the\nkernel execute our shellcode! And game over 😀\nFor those unfamiliar with the Hardware Abstraction Layer (or HAL),\nit is a software layer aiming to provide a common unified interface to heterogeneous hardware (motherboard, CPUs, network cards, etc.). On Windows, it resides in hal.dll that is invoked by ntoskrnl.exe:\n\nSpeaking of the HAL, hal.dll has some very interesting properties\nexploitation-wise. Among others, my first attempt was to overwrite the\npointers table located at 0xFFD00000 (on x86 and x64). Actually the range\n0xFFD00000-0xFFE00000 is interesting because since the HAL driver is loaded so early (actually\neven before the Windows memory manager) during the boot process, it’ll require\nknown static addresses to map and store information collected about the hardware\nin memory. Researchers such as\n\n@d_olex\n\n have explored this path as early as 2011 to use it as an exploit vector as Win7\nSP1 used to have this section static and with Read/Write/Execute permission\n(although it exists on Windows 8 and up, it is “only” Read/Write)\n\n\n\nNote: Looking for references about HAL interrupt table corruption, I came across this recent and fantastic\nblog post by \n@NicoEconomou\n\n that covers exactly this approach. I might dedicate a future post applying this technique to HEVD as this table is also an excellent target for WWW scenario.\nBuilding the exploit\nNote: Some convenience functions of this exploit are located in\nthe KePwnLib.h library I wrote. Feel free to use it!\nThe very first part of the exploit is very similar to what we did in the former post, with the new IOCTL code:\n\nAnd when sending the IOCTL, pass in a buffer of 2 ULONG_PTR (index 0 is the\nWhat, 1 is the Where).\n\nAnd if we test with dummy values:\n\n\n\nThe WHAT corresponds to our shellcode (lpShellcode), which we know. Now we need the\nWHERE (i.e. nt!HalDispatchTable[1])… which a kernel address! As we know, any\nmapped address can be translated to MmappedAddress = ImageBase + offset.\nGet the Kernel Image Base Address from undocumented SystemInformationClass\nBy reading Alex Ionescu - I got 99 problems but a kernel pointer ain’t one (REcon 2013) I discovered that by passing a System Information Class of SystemModuleInformation (0xb) to NtQuerySystemInformation, Windows will leak all kernel modules information (full path, image base address, etc.), including the kernel itself! So finding the image base of the kernel ntoskrnl.exe can be done as follow (in very approximate pseudo-code - just to give an idea):\n\nAll structures used are very well defined and documented in the Process Hacker tool source code. If you go with your implementation of the exploit, you might want to read that first.\nNow we’ve got the ImageBase component.\nGet the offset from the kernel image\nThis step is actually much easier. All we need to do is to :\n\nload the kernel image ntoskrnl.exe and store its base address\nretrieve the address of HalDispatchTable\nsubtract the two pointers found above\n\nOr again, in very pseudo-C:\n\nAnd yeah, that’s all! Now that we’ve also got the offset, we know that\nHalDispatchTableInKernel = KernelImageBaseAddress + lNtHalDispatchTableOffset,\nwhich is the WHERE condition we needed above! Therefore, we have everything to\noverwrite nt!HalDispatchTable[1].\nTriggering the corrupted HAL entry\nNow that we’ve successfully overwritten the HalDispatchTable, we need a way\nto force a call to the corrupted pointer in nt!HalDispatchTable[1].\nAs aforementioned, that can be done with the undocumented\nnt!NtQueryIntervalProfile. So the last piece of our exploit can be written\nas simply as\n\nAssembling all the pieces\nThe clean final exploit can be found here.\n\n\n\nYou can now enjoy the privileged shell so well deserved!\nAbout PatchGuard\nWindows XP/2003 and up use\nKernel Patch Protection (aka PatchGuard) to\nprotect sensitive locations, including the SSDT and HAL (among other). Since this\ntechnique will modify the HAL table, PG will detect it and force a\nAlthough PG bypass is not the subject of this post, it should be noted that\nseveral public papers and tools cover ways to bypass it.\nConclusion\nIn this chapter we’ve covered how to exploit Arbitrary Write conditions in the kernel to achieve code execution, by leveraging undocumented procedures and functions that leak valuable kernel information straight from userland.

It\nlooks like it is searching for one or more valid PE executable files in the\nflareon2016challenge folder. It does a few extra checks (is it Intel machine\nin PE header, etc.) and if everything passes, calls 0x010146C0.\nThis function will take the timestamps from\nthe\nPE header\nof the current program (notepad.exe) and the PE file mapped to memory. If\nthose 2 values are the ones expected, then 2 functions are called successively:\n\nFunction @ 0x1014350 which will format the timestamp of the mapped file and\nMessageBox-it \n\n\nFunction @ 0x1014BAC which will open a file key.bin in\nflareon2016challenge folder and write 8 bytes from some offset\nin the mapped file into it.\n\nOr in horrible pseudo-code:\n\nSo now we know how the decoding key is built, but we don’t know which PE to\nuse. This guessing game made me lose too much time. The hint was to use 2016 PE\nfiles from last year’s FlareOn challenge.\nIn the many folders of\nthe FlareOn3 Zip archive, we could find several PE files whose timestamps match perfectly\nwith the ones we are looking for. All we need now is drop those files in the\nflareon2016challenge directory, and tweak notepad.exe to update its\ntimestamp.

It then enters\na loop of game, where the player (us) have 0x64 attempts to win the game.\n\n\n\nInside the loop, the function play() (at 0x4038d6) is called and will print the game grid\nand display whether your shot was hit or miss. The coordinates themselves are\nread from the function enter_coor() (at 0x40377d).\n\n\n\nSo if we want to win, we need to\n\ndisable the randomness of the game board\ndetermine which values are being compared when we set coordinates\n\nTo disable the randomness, I simply used LD_PRELOAD variable against a\nhomemade shared library that will override calls to rand() and rand() to a\ndeterministic output:\n\nWith randomness out of the way, our board game with the position of all the\nships will be the same at every runtime.\nThe function draw_grid() called with a pointer to the game board as\nparameter. By reading it, the function knows how to print a cell (empty, full)\nand therefore knows the configuration of the board.\n\nThis is a bitmask representing the position of the board: to make easier I wrote\na Python function to convert this value into a list of position on the board:\n\nWe get 2 things: one, we have all the positions for the enemy boats; two, the\ndisposition of the boats on the board forms an ASCII letter (here ‘F’).\nBy advancing through all the levels, we can collect more letters:\n\n0x0008087808087800 →  “f”\n0x008888f888888800 →  “h”\n0x7e8181f10101817e →  “g”\n0xf090909090000000 →  “u”\n0x0000f8102040f800 →  “z”\n0x0000000905070907 →  “r”\n0x7010701070000000 →  “e”\n0x0006090808083e00 →  “j”\n0x1028444444000000 →  “v”\n0x0c1212120c000000 →  “o”\n\nReaching the final level and entering the valid positions of boats gets a\nmessage:\n\nBy simply applying this formula, we find the result to be ohgjurervfgurehz\nwhich when in uppercase ROT13-ed gives BUTWHEREISTHERUM. Give this password as\ninput, and after a bit of computation time obtain the key to finish the level:\n\n\n\nBack to Menu\nChallenge 6\nInstruction\n\nSolution\npayload.dll is a PE32+ DLL x86-64. The\nDLL doesn’t sweat much info out of the box, so I decide to use both dynamic and\nstatic analysis. Although the static part is perfectly handled by IDA, I wanted\nthe dynamic analysis to be custom so I had to make a small loader for this\nlibrary.\nSince the notation\nis stdecl, the\narguments are passed to registers in the following order: rcx, rdx, r8, r9\n\nWith this simple library loader, I have an accurate way of invoking any location\nwithing the DLL and display runtime information directly inside WinDBG.\nIDA quickly pointed me to the function at offset 0x5A50 - which I’ve called\nFunc3().

We know why we\ngot key[25] now, but we don’t know where the passphrase comes from. This is\ndone in the function 0x180005C40 that will do the decoding of a part of .rdata\nat index given by the return of function 0x180004710.\nSo to get the keys, we must decode all sections in .rdata:\n\nThe following passphrases are collected:\n\nAnd then force calling the Func3() function with the specific password:\n\nThat will print out successively the key parts via successive MessageBox calls.\n\nwhich translated gives wuuut-exp0rts@flare-on.com\nBack to Menu\nChallenge 7\nInstruction\n\nSolution\nzsud.exe is a PE32 binary.

Debugging the binary with dnSpy gives a whole new view as to what\nit’s doing: the function Smth() receives a Base64 encoded string, which once decoded is\nAES decrypted with the key “soooooo_sorry_zis_is_not_ze_flag”. The result is a\nPowershell script that is being invoked, and that is another maze game, entirely\nwritten in Powershell. The script can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\nThe game is an escape room, so it would make sense that the flag will be given\nto us if we escape!

This format\n(Intel HEX)\nis frequently used for sharing encoded firmware, and so the python-intelhex\nmodule provides a useful script to convert it back to binary\n(hex2bin.py). From the string inside the firmware, we learn that this firmware\nis meant to be\nused on\na Arduino Uno board. This\nboard embeds an Atmel AVR 8bit CPU, running at 16MHz. Easily\nenough, Google points us to the datasheet of the processor.\nBeing totally new to AVR, I stop the challenge at that point for long enough to\nread a good part of the datasheet, which proved to be extremely useful for the\nrest of this exercise.\nWith a much better understanding of AVR, I setup a SimAVR environment and also\ncompiled simduino, which allows me to connect a GDB to it, and debug the runtime:\n\nSimduino will open a /dev/pts that can be used for UART (so we can use tools\nlike picocom or minicom to debug it).\n\n\n\nThe firmware seems to be expecting a new PIN configuration: luckily I came\nacross this information in the datasheet (“35. Register Summary”).\n\n\n\nAfter trying\nto manipulate the PINB and PINC (resp. at offset 0x23 and 0x26) without success,\nI saw that a change of value in PIND (offset 0x29) immediately provoked a\nresponse from the firmware:\n\nIn picocom:\n\nSince the possible values are limited to 1 byte (8bit), and being lazy I wrote a\nGDB script to brute-force all the values\n\nAnd then I use xdotool to programmatically send the right xkeysyms commands to\nthe GDB terminal:\n\nWent for a coffee, and when back saw the pleasant screen:\n\n\n\nThis challenge was a good reminder that reading the documentation first kept me\nfrom spending probably hours of not understanding how the CPU was getting\ninput/output data from the PIN or what the ABI was doing. So more than ever, RTFM!\nBack to Menu\nChallenge 10\nInstruction\n\nSolution\nAnother guessing game type of challenge. The challenge comes as a PHP script\nnamed shell.php. It was solvable in 3 different steps:\nStep 1: get the key length\nThis script is a mess so the cleaned version was\npushed here.\nThis challenge is not about cracking the MD5 hash given, but reversing the way\nthe variable $block is manipulated with the XOR operation. We don’t know the\nkey $param, including its length. However, we do know that after L4 the\nstrlen($param) will be in [32..64]. Additionally, we know after this line that\nevery byte of $param is in the hexadecimal namespace (“0123456789abcdef”). And\nfinally, because of the call\nto create_function\nline 15, we know that the block once de-XOR-ed will have all bytes in\nstring.printable.\nNow the guessing game starts: we must guess at the same time the length and\nthe key. So the idea is in pseudo-code\n\nThis gives us a good iteration pattern, allowing us to narrow down all possible\nvalues and find the possible length for the key, as done in bf1.py\n\nUnanimously, we find that if the length of $param is 64 bytes, we have at\nleast one candidate that ensures that we can de-xor $block and get ASCII back\nfor each byte of the key.\nSo if $param = md5($param) . substr(MD5(strrev($param)), 0, strlen($param));\nand strlen($param) == 64, it means that our key o_o is 32 byte long, which\nway too huge to brute-force. Consequently we must unxor the block by another way,\nwithout knowing the key.\nStep 2: unxor all the blocks!\nThe Step1 allowed us to get the key length along with a list of potential\ncandidates for each position ([0, 63]).\nThis 2nd step directly extends the earlier one by trying to brute-force chunk by\nchunk.\nThis will be the main idea:\n\nI used Python’s itertools.product to generate all the candidate blocks, and\nlittle by little recovered the value for $param:\n\nAfter a few iteration, it appears that the encoded block contains not just pure\nPHP but also HTML, which allowed me to perfect the condition for finding a valid candidate\nAfter many iterations, we get the value for $param:\n\nStep 3\nEntering the correct value for $param found in step 2 allow us to discover the\ndecoded script passed\nto create_function().\nAnd back to square 1, we have 3 new base64-encoded blocks to decode. Depending\non the value given in the $_POST['t'] (can be ‘c’, ‘s’ or ‘w’), will split the\nkey every 3 character, starting from index 0, 1, or 2 (respectively).\nI took a huge assumption here, which was that $key would be the flag to end the\nchallenge. Therefore, even though we don’t know its length (yet), we know that\nit ends with @flare-on.com.\nSo for this step, I used the same technique than step2 but split the key every 3\ncharacters and see if the block of byte was successfully decoded.\n\nJust like step1 this approach gives us 2 possible length for the flag prefix\n(i.e. before @flare-on.com): 8 or 9 bytes.\nSo there again, semi-manual brute-force:\n\nWe quickly notice that the output has some HTML in it, so we can discard\ncandidates with invalid HTML patterns. For example:\n\nOnly code with key=AAAAAAAA4froc makes most sense so it must be it. So we’ll\nassume this is how the key ends, and brute-force the byte before, and so on, and\nso forth. Reiterating this for all bytes, we get the first subkey to be\nk0='t_rsaat_4froc'.\nAnd reiterating the exact same thing for the 2nd and 3rd base64-encoded block\nand we get all the subkeys:\n\nBack to Menu\nChallenge 11\nInstruction\n\nSolution\nThis challenge was out of space! And so fun! It comes as a PE32 file\nnamed covfefe.exe.\nThe most notable string (http://bitly.com/98K8eH)\nfrom the PE points us nostalgically to\nRick Astley timeless masterpiece, “Never Gonna Give You Up”.\nMany other strings appear, but are weirdly aligned to one DWORD per character:\n\n\n\nActually covfefe.exe is very simple, and only asks for finding a correct\npassword. The PE itself only:\n\nrandomly chooses an integer in [0, 9[ and store in 0x0403008+0x110*4\nstarts the VM itself at 0x0403008, and jumps to it\n\nThe VM is an array of int32_t so\nlogique_addr_in_pe = 0x0403008 + relative_addr_in_vm*4\nThe execution of the virtual machine starts at pc_start = vm + 0x463. And each\ninstruction is executed in the same way:\n\nSince the code is super easy, I decided to recreate the C source code from\nit. So first, I used WinDBG to dump the VM location:\n\nAnd used this to create\na\nC script that\nwould run the VM as well. The reason for that is that now I can set breakpoint\nand analyse the VM more precisely. I also used Binary Ninja to\nwrite\na new custom architecture. The\nreason for that\nbeing that it greatly helped tracking down operations at the bytecode level\nof the VM.\n\n\n\nWe know that we must provide a good password to validate the task. So there must\nbe a comparison that fails as soon as a wrong character is entered. Those\nnew tools were of great help to identify the culprit: the comparison instruction\nis done in the block at 0xde6.\n\n\n\nNow that we know that, all I need was to use the C script to “set a breakpoint”\nat 0xde9 and see what value was expected.\n\n\n\nKnowing this, creating the brute-force script\n(cov.py)\nwas the next immediate step:\n\n\n\nAnd finally recover the key to this level = subleq_and_reductio_ad_absurdum.\nBack to Menu\nChallenge 12\nInstruction\n\nSolution\nThis level alone could have been an entire CTF. It came as 2 files:\n\nan 85KB PE32 file, coolprogram.exe\na 5.5MB PCAP trace,\n20170801_1300_filtered.pcap\n\nExtracting secondstage.exe\ncoolprogram.exe is a Borland compiled PE file that is nothing more than a\nstager to download and execute the real payload. Using API Monitor, we can trace\nthat it attempts to connect to FQDN maybe.suspicious.to, checking also that\nthe domain name doesn’t point to the localhost\n\n\n\nThe behavior seems consistent with the first TCP stream of the PCAP. However,\nthe data received seems encoded/encrypted:\n\nIDR and IDA helped identify the “real main” function to be at 0x04103DC, which\nperforms sequentially the following operations:\n\nunxor the URL from memory: the URL is located at 0x04102B4 and xor-ed with\n0x73\nperform the HTTP GET request to get the secondstage\ndecode the buffer, recovering a valid PE file, secondstage.exe\ninvoke secondstage.exe by hollowing the default HTTP browser\n\n\n\n\nInstead of decoding manually the encoded response from the C2 server, we can be\nlazy by recovering secondstage.exe breaking at 0x4104C1:\n\nInitial analysis secondstage\nThanks to CFF Explorer, one can easily edit secondstage.exe PE header to\ndeactivate the randomization of the code by\nunsetting\nIMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE\nand rebuild the header.\nsecondstage analysis starts at 0x405220 by initializing a bunch a stuff,\nincluding loading all dynamically loaded functions into an array of points,\nensuring a bit of obfuscation during static analysis, since all function calls\nwill be performed by indirect calls. Then if the executable is run on\nclient-side, initiates the connection to the C2 server:\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time a packet is received the function 0x0402C50 is called for parsing the\nnew message, and sending the answer back. The C2 is still behind the FQDN\nmaybe.suspicious.to which in the PCAP file is associated to the IP address\n52.0.104.200.\nReversing the communication protocol\nA big part of this challenge consisted in understanding the protocol, because\nonce entirely assimilated, every piece of code would fall into place.\nAn initial glimpse into the second TCP stream of the PCAP reveils already many\nvaluable information regarding the protocol:\n\nit is a non-standard (i.e. custom) binary protocol\nit is (for most part) non encrypted\nsome parts of the header can be instantly recognized (magic=‘2017’, the\nsize of the header, size of the data, etc.)\nit transmits some PE code (presence of strings like “text”, “rdata”,\n“reloc”, “kernel32.dll”, names of methods, etc.)\n\nThe function 0x403210 reveals a whole deal regarding the protocol: when a new\npacket is received, the function ensures that its length is at least 0x24 bytes,\nand that the first 4 bytes are equal to “2017”. This will be the aspect of the\nfirst 0x24 bytes of header:\n\nWhat the hell are those modules? What is their magic number?\nTo understand that, I wrote a “replayer” that would spoof the C2 IP address, and\nreplay all the packets to the instance of secondstage. After a few packets,\nthe !address showed that some new memory areas were allocated in the address\nspace, all with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permission, all starting with\nLM.... Searching for the constant 0x4d4c (‘LM’ in little endian), IDA spotted\nthe instruction 004053CE cmp     edx, 4D4Ch, which happens to be followed by a\ncall to Kernel32!VirtualAlloc() with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40) set for\npermission, then a LoadLibraryA. This must be it, so we can now use WinDBG to dump all those modules:\n\n8 modules were found. Each of them can be convert back to a valid PE format by\nreplacing “LM\\x00\\x00” with “MZ\\x00\\x00”, and “NOP\\x00” with\n“PE\\x00\\x00”. Finally the entry point must be xored with the value 0xABCDABCD.\n\n\nReversing the “Loadable Modules”\nAll those modifications give us 8 DLL that are sent by the C2 and loaded in\nsecondstage, with the following names in them\n\nr.dll\nt.dll\n6.dll\nx.dll\nz.dll\nf.dll\ns.dll\nm.dll\n\nUsing Diaphora to bin-diff those DLL showed that they are 99% similar, except\nfor a handful of functions. So naturally I focused reversing only those\nfunctions.\nIn all DLLs (and even secondstage), one function could always be found doing\nsomething like:\n\nWhich appears to be the function called when a packet is received, and that the\n“magic” field matched to the DLL. Symetrically, another function could be found,\nbut this one to build a response packet from this module.  Reversing all those\nmodules could be summarized in the table below:\n| Name | Magic  | Description  | Category |\n| secondstage.exe | 51298F741667D7ED2941950106F50545  | Handles basic packets handling, loads modules, sends MessageBox messages, stop process, etc.  | * |\n| r.dll | C30B1A2DCB489CA8A724376469CF6782 | RC4 implementation  | CRPT |\n| t.dll | 38BE0F624CE274FC61F75C90CB3F5915 | Byte shuffling | CRPT |\n| 6.dll | BA0504FCC08F9121D16FD3FED1710E60 | Base64 (with custom alphabet) implementation  | COMP|\n| x.dll | B2E5490D2654059BBBAB7F2A67FE5FF4 | Modified XTEA  | CRPT |\n| z.dll | 5FD8EA0E9D0A92CBE425109690CE7DA2 | zlib | COMP |\n| f.dll | F47C51070FA8698064B65B3B6E7D30C6 | didn’t see the need for reversing | ? |\n| s.dll | F46D09704B40275FB33790A362762E56 | Send/Receive commands  | CMD |\n| m.dll | A3AECCA1CB4FAA7A9A594D138A1BFBD5 | Desktop Screenshot | CMD |\n3 types of plugin actions can be found (as detailed by 0x04025DF):\n\nCMD: send and receive command to the client (get OS information, execute\ncommand in terminal, etc.)\nCRPT: cryptographic operation\nCOMP: compression operation\n\nAnd here is where the header field DataSize2 (at header+0x10) comes in handy:\nactions triggered by crypto or compression modules can produce an output whose\nlength is different from the original header.DataSize. So the field\nDataSize2 indicates the size of the output after the cryptographic or\ncompression operation has been done. Although some crypto operations were used, the key (and IV when needed) could\nalways be found in the message header.\nChaining modules together allows to create some pretty complex\noutput (for example Base64( zlib_deflate( XTEA(data) ) ) ), that would be\nabsolutely impossible to reverse correctly, solely with the static analysis of\nthe PCAP file. So if we want to reconstruct the data, we must write a parser at some point to\nparse the data of the PCAP (the final version of the parser can be found here).\nReconstructing the screen capture\n\n\n\nm.dll captures the desktop as a bitmap and send the raw data back to the C2\n(uses the same function as\nthe\nMSDN example). But\nbecause it is a pure bitmap, there is no information of the dimensions of the\nimage. In addition, the image is split in several packets, some of them are sent\nin plain text, like this\n\nWhereas others are compressed and/or encrypted by the different algorithms\nmentioned above. However, they are all sent sequentially. Once all the fragments\nextracted by the parser, they were merged into a raw file. Thanks to a good tip\nby  alex_k_polyakov, I used the\nwebsite RawPixels.net, and when setting a resolution of\n1420x720, the following capture showed up:\n\n\n\nAfter all those efforts, finally a good lead on the challenge to find.\nMore Loadable Modules !!\nContinuing the replay of packets showed something very interesting:\n\n\n\nsecondstage.exe was sending commands to a child process cmd.exe, attempting\nto reach a host whose NetBIOS name is larryjohnson-pc, and if found, would run\ndrop 2 files in C:\\staging, pse.exe and srv2.exe. Finally it would execute\nthe command:\n\npse.exe is nothing more\nthan\nSysInternals PsExec,\nso the command would push and execute srv2.exe as the user larry.johnson. If\nall went well, secondstage.exe then attempts to load a new Loadable Module,\np.dll, whose magic is 77D6CE92347337AEB14510807EE9D7BE. This DLL will be used\nto proxy the packets from/to the C2 directly to srv2.exe via secondstage.exe. In\naddition, the C2 then sends a few new Loadable Modules to the running srv2.exe\nprocess:\n| Name | Magic  | Description  | Category |\n| b.dll | 2965E4A19B6E9D9473F5F54DFEF93533 | Blowfish implementation (CBC Mode) | CRPT |\n| e.dll | 8746E7B7B0C1B9CF3F11ECAE78A3A4BC | Block XOR | CRPT |\n| d.dll | 46C5525904F473ACE7BB8CB58B29968A | DES implementation (CBC Mode) | CRPT |\n| c.dll | 9B1F6EC7D9B42BF7758A094A2186986B | Camellia implementation (ECB Mode) | CRPT |\n| a.dll | 503B6412C75A7C7558D1C92683225449 | ApLib compression | COMP |\n| l.dll | 0A7874D2478A7713705E13DD9B31A6B1 | LZO compression | COMP |\nBack to Menu\nSmart parsing of the PCAP\nIt is altogether 15 Loadable Modules that are needed to be implemented for\ndecompression or decryption. In some cases, the implementation of the algorithm\nwas not standard (for example RC4), so I had to rewrite from scratch according\nto the reversed DLL solely. Particularly the ApLib module was a pain to use properly.\nBut it was critical that our implementation strictly stick  to the one from the\nmodule. So a lot (really a lot) of testing was required all the time, as even a one\nbyte mistake could make the content of a packet unreadable for the upper layer,\nleading to not be able to decrypt files later on…\nBut after some long hours perfecting the decrypting script, the result pays off\ndirectly, and all traffic is now in plain text, revealing some crispy information:\n\n\n\n\n\n2 new files can be found from the extract:\n\ncf.exe a C# compiled file\na 561972 byte file beginning with the pattern cryp\n\ncf.exe doesn’t show much mystery: it takes 2 parameters, a path to file, and a\nbase64 encoded key. And it will AES encrypt the file with the given key.\n\n\n\nAs seen in the capture above, we were capable of decrypting the packet that\nholds the command used for encrypting the file.\n\nSo we can build a decryptor in few lines of Python\n\n\nWe’ve got the real challenge!\nAnd to conclude, unzip lab10.zip with the password from the screenshot:\ninfectedinfectedinfectedinfectedinfected919. This will drop a file in\nGoChallenge/build/challenge10, which is a Go challenge in ELF. But when we\nexecute it, we see a well deserve reward:\n\nConclusion\nThank you to FireEye for those fun challenges… and congratulations to all the\nwinners (especially those who managed to finish in under a week, massive\nprops)!! I hope those writeups don’t make those challenges look trivial, they\nweren’t (only ~130 over more\nthan a thousand participants\ncompleted the 12 challenges).

Executable parsers are\nnot a new thing (pyelftools, pefile, etc…)\nbut that one picked my curiosity (just like most Quarkslab projects) because it\nalso provides dead simple instrumentation functions. To top it up, LIEF is easy\nto use and well documented, which is becoming a rare perk in the circus of\ninfosec tools.\nBy reading some blog posts about LIEF, I came across a new\nfeature:\neasily adding arbitrary functions to an ELF export table. I highly recommend to\ndig through this post if you haven’t done so already.\nWhen I was done reading, I realized one of the many good applications to this\nfeature would be fuzzing. But why not use AFL you\nmay ask? Well, AFL is an awesome (awesome awesome) tool, but it  fuzzes the\nwhole binary by providing some local mutated input. This has 2 disadvantages for\nprecise, targeted function fuzzing:\n\nperformance: in default mode (i.e. non persistent), AFL spawns and runs the\nentire binary, which obviously adds the process creation/deletion time,\nalong with all the code before reaching the function(s) we’re aiming;\nmodularity: it is not easy to fuzz network service parsing mechanism with\nit. I know\nof already existing attempts to fix\nthis, but I find them too hacky and poorly scalable.\n\nOn the other side we have LLVM’s own LibFuzzer, which is an awesome (awesome\nawesome) library to fuzz, well… libraries. And fortunately, not everything is a library\n(sshd, httpd)\nAnd that’s exactly where LIEF kicks in… How about using LIEF to export one (or\nmany) functions from the ELF binary we target, into a shared object, and then use\nLibFuzzer to fuzz it! On top of that, we can also use the\ncompilers sanitizers to track invalid\nmemory access! But would that even work?\nIt turns out it did, big time and after successfully playing on simple PoCs, I\nrealized this technique was relevant to dig into, so I chose to put it to\npractice by trying to find real vulnerabilities.\nConcrete example: finding CVE-2018-6789\nWhat better way to illustrate this technique than with a concrete example: earlier this\nweek, \n@mehqq_\n\n released a great blog post about CVE-2018-6789 detailing the exploit steps for an off-by-one vulnerability she discovered in Exim. The issue was fixed in cf3cd306062a08969c41a1cdd32c6855f1abecf1 and given the CVE 2018-6789.\nExim is a MTA which once compiled is a standalone binary. So AFL would be of little help (network service), but it is a perfect practice case for LIEF + LibFuzzer.\nWe must compile Exim as PIE (usually done with setting -fPIC in CFLAGS and -pie in LDFLAGS). But we also need the address sanitizer since without them, off-by-one overflow in the heap may go unoticed.\nCompiling the target with ASAN &amp; PIE\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        in some cases, the use of ASAN fails to create the configuration file required\n\n        \n\n\nfor the compilation. So edit $EXIM/src/scripts/Configure-config.h shell script\nto avoid the premature ending:\n\nThe compilation will occur normally and once compiled we can use checksec from pwntools on the binary and make\nsure it’s PIE and ASAN compatible:\n\nExporting the targeted functions\nFrom the write-up, the vulnerable function is b64decode() in src/base64.c\nwhose prototype is:\n\nThis function is not static and the binary not stripped, so we can spot it\neasily with readelf:\n\nSo now we know that we want to export the function b64decode at PIE offset\n0xcb0bd. We can use the following simple script to export the functions using\nLIEF (&gt;=0.9):\n\nWe also need to export store_reset_3() which is used to free the structures.\n\nWrite a LibFuzzer loader to invoke the targeted function\nFirst we need a handle to the library:\n\nAnd reconstruct the function b64decode() based on its prototype:\n\nb64decode() can now be called:\n\nThat works! And we can thank only LIEF for that, by making the instrumention of\narbitrary functions a child game.\nFuzz da planet!\nWe can now use this skeleton to build a LibFuzzer-based fuzzer around this:\n\nCompile it, run it, and be amazed 😎 :\n\nWe’re running more than 1 million executions/second/core on the function\nb64decode, not bad eh?\nAnd in less than a 1 second, we get the heap overflow found by \n@mehqq_\n\n, CVE-2018-6789:\n\n\n\n\nNote: Earlier this week, I was notified by \n@mehqq_\n\n that this is OOB read is a different bug. I will post an update soon showcasing the actual bug instead. My bad for the confusion.\n\nFinal words\nAlthough this technique is not as click-and-play like AFL since it requires a bit more work, it offers non-negligible pros:\n\nexcellent reliability, makes easy for fuzzing network services → focus on\nparsing functions (no network stack to handle etc.). perfect for can focus on\nspecific points (packet parsing, message processing, etc.)\ncrazy performance: no need to spawn the whole binary\nthere is actually no need for the source code, we can use LibFuzzer on\nblack-box binaries\nlow hardware requirements allow to fuzz at very high rate even on weak\nhardware (and transform your RaspberryPis into a fuzzing cluster 😎)\n\nBut nothing ever being perfect, there are obviously also cons:\n\nneed to code almost every fuzzer (so only for C/C++ coding people)\nspecific edge cases you might need to consider (beware of memory leaks!!)\nwe must determine the function prototype. This is easy when the source code\nis open (FOSS projects), but black-box binaries may require some prior\nreversing. Tools like Binary Ninja Commercial\nLicense may also be of great help for automating this task.\n\nAll in all, it is a pretty neat approach made possible through 2 awesome tools. I do hope LIEF development keeps being active to bring us more goodies like this!\nThanks for reading 😁 !\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2018-03-11-fuzzing-arbitrary-functions-in-elf-binaries/","title":"Fuzzing arbitrary functions in ELF binaries"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2018-11-02-some-time-travel-musings/":{"body":"If WinDbg was already setting the standard of what modern debuggers should be like, no doubt WinDbg Preview brings it to a next level. The JavaScript API is not perfect yet but already very efficient, so we don’t have to rely on PyKd for proper (and portable) WinDbg scripting (I won’t even mention WDS). As a start, I could not recommend enough reading \n@0vercl0k\n\n if you haven’t already read it, which not only covers TTD but a lot more.\nTime-Travel Debugging\nIntroduction\nSince the feature got publicly available last year, there hasn’t been that much coverage on the topic and as I finally took some time to fiddle with it for various cases (from malware analysis to CTF) I figured I could contribute with a quick write-up.\nAs the name implies, Time-Travel Debugging is a tool that will allow to travel through the runtime of process that you create or attach to. It’ll monitor everything then store it a separate indexed database file, that can be fed to WinDbg Preview. The debugger will then have a Read-Only access on the execution, allowing to jump back and forth to desired points of the runtime. That’s already quite nice, but what makes it more powerful is the integration with the Data Model (via the dx command) and the JS API.\nTime Travel + Data Model\nTTD 101: Moving around\nI was curious to see what could be done so I decided to record via WinDbg a simple Notepad session. TTD is as simple as it gets: start WinDbg (as Admin), and launch the target executable after checking the Record process with Time Travel Debugging\n\n\n\nTyped some stuff and closed notepad. WinDbg starts by reading the trace and indexing the database, and breaks at the loader entry point. The indexes (look like XX:YY where X and Y are hex-digits) are like coordinates that can be used to travel around so we can move to an absolute position like\n\nIt is also possible to simply step-over backwards (p-), step-into backwards (t-), or go backwards (g-) - one can notice that commands for backwards are the same as for forward, with a - suffixed to the command. All the other commands, like for breakpoints, or accessing memory/registers work just the same.\nThat’s already quite fun, but WinDbg can go a lot further.\nEnter the Debugger Data Model…\nWinDbg can use LINQ to query the TTD database, to synthetize a lot more of runtime information in a very painless way. To do so, a new attribute TTD was added to the runtime variables $curprocess\n\nand $cursession\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        You might want to enable DML too (by running the command .prefer_dml 1) if you want to click your way through those methods.\n\n        \n\nAmong some of the most interesting parts, we can now query function calls, like\n\nWill count the number of calls to function matching ntdll!mem* pattern, or even filter function calls per parameter\n\nWhich will filter the calls to function matching Kernel*!VirtualAlloc* pattern, where the 4th parameter is PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40).\nAnother useful feature is the memory access, exposed by\n\nTo take the real life example of a self-decrypting packer, that would allocate some memory (likely in RWX), then decrypt the code and finally jump to it. If we were to reverse such packer, we don’t care much about how the payload is decrypted (could be a simple XOR, could be AES, could be custom crypto, etc.), what we only care about is what the code looks like once decrypted. And that becomes stupidly easy with TTD + DDM:\n\nDone! Then you can .writemem that code into a file that IDA can disassemble.\n\nUpdate (11/11/2018) :\nAnd since all this goodness can be used from JavaScript (via the host.namespace.Debugger namespace), it’s really not far to write scripts for automatically dump such payloads, track heap allocations, enumerate all files created etc. And it came to me a surprise (not really actually, \n@0vercl0k\n\n just told me), that when using the ttd.exe binary as a standalone, one can pass the -children flag allowing TTD to also record children processes.\n\nThe Time-Travel Debugging tool from #WinDbg Preview can be used as a standalone binary (ttd.exe)Copy the TTD\\ directory and you can use TTD without #WinDbg, allowing you to script your #TTD recording useful for:- #fuzzing crash replay- #malware analysis- bug tracking pic.twitter.com/yYZrkNRmD1— windbgtips (@windbgtips) November 11, 2018\n\nNothing is forgotten\nBack to the notepad session. Even though no file was saved to disk, I did type some stuff on the keyboard, so I figured that they must have been recorded somewhere by TTD. Let’s hunt them down!\nNotepad uses Windows’ Messaging mechanism so that when a key is stroke, an event is passed down to notepad (or any other app fwiw) who decides whether to pick it up or not (the Windows Message internals is not the focus of this post but this is a pretty good introduction), to know whether the canvas must be redrawn, the window close, etc. This messaging system being articulated around fetching messages (via user32!GetMessage) and pushing them (via user32!SendMessage). The GetMessage() function prototype is :\n\nIt is easily possible to filter those calls as mentioned earlier:\n\nOne way I found to narrow so many calls down is to see is to focus rather on the message itself, which is Parameters[0] of the function call:\n\n\n\nIt seems that the message is always stored at 0xa30fb6fc00, and has the following structure\n\nWe can now monitor all the memory accesses to the address 0xa30fb6fc00\n\nMSG.wParam in particular will hold the value of the keycode when the key is stroke, so we can also narrow it to ASCII characters\n\nThat’s a lot more interesting so we use LINQ even further to print the characters directly by casting the Value to char and we get\n\nHere we see multiple times the same character: the reason being that for one key stroke, multiple events are raised (WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP). Since we haven’t done any filtering at the DDM level, notepad captures all the events. It would be fairly easy from that point to create a JS script to only get one type of message, but this will be left at the curiosity of the reader (focus on capturing only the messages of type WM_KEYDOWN (0x100).\nLast words\nThis concludes this light post about TTD and its DDM integration.\nTTD brings a new approach to traditional debugging which is a huge plus. Not only that, but its integration in WinDbg with LINQ and DDM makes it even more powerful, and I hope this small post helped in making those tools more approachable.\nIn the mean time, I’ll leave you with some links to dig deeper:\n\nDebugger data model, Javascript &amp; x64 exception handling\nChannel9 - Introduction to Time Travel Debugging\nChannel9 - Advanced Time Travel Debugging\nWinDbg YouTube Playlist\n\nCheers!\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2018-11-02-some-time-travel-musings/","title":"Some Time Travel musings"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2018-12-02-quick-visualization-of-a-binary-file/":{"body":"Here’s a simple trick that I learned from the amazing  \n@scanlime\n\n to quickly (and universally) visualize the distribution of byte of any binary file, using the Portable Graymap Format (PGM) format.\nOn Windows:\n\nOr on Linux/OSX:\n\nThen open the file with any image viewer like feh or IrFanView.\n\n\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2018-12-02-quick-visualization-of-a-binary-file/","title":"Quick visualization of a binary file"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2018-12-30-goodbye-virtualbox-hello-hyper-v/":{"body":"A few scrap notes about my migration from VirtualBox to Hyper-V (in case I attempt to do the same again in the future 😁)\nMoving a VirtualBox VM to Hyper-V\nHyper-V doesn’t support OVF/OVA format, but it is possible to convert a VBox VDI to HV VHD by:\n\nIn VirtualBox: copy the hard drive from File → Virtual Media Manager.

For a minute, the field name misled me to think threads were now Named Objects on Windows. What it is instead, is a convenient and native way to name a thread, any thread by attaching a UNICODE_STRING structure to it. Thanks to \n@PetrBenes\n\n’s invaluable ntdiff it became clear that this field was introduced with Windows 10, more specifically 1607.\n\n\n\nSource\nSo how to use it? Is it even reachable? The answer was as immediate as Googling “windows set thread name” which leads to an MSDN article. This article mentions the SetThreadDescription() in processthreadsapi.h. Disassembling kernelbase.dll shows that this function is merely a wrapper around the syscall NtSetInformationThread() with a ThreadInformationClass set to 0x26 (ThreadNameInformation).\n\n\n\nOnce in ntoskrnl (IDA), the syscall performs various checks (is the _ETHREAD.ThreadName already allocated, is the input size and buffer correct etc.), and then call ExAllocatePoolWithTag() with a tag of ThNm and as NonPagedPoolNx, and the size provided by the UNICODE_STRING structure, plus sizeof(UNICODE_STRING). Finally, the user buffer will be memmove-ed into this new pool.\n\n\n\nSince the unicode buffer and its size are fully user controlled, this means that the syscall NtSetInformationThread(0x26) provides a way to allocate an arbitrary sized pool in the kernel, for each thread we create and/or can open a handle to via OpenThread().\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        The code was tested on Windows 10 RS5 x64. To work on 32b one might need to adjust the offsets. Also Windows must be at least 1607.\n\n        \n\nThe following code is enough to populate the _ETHREAD.ThreadName of a designed thread:\n\nThe acute observer may notice that only THREAD_SET_LIMITED_INFORMATION class information is used. Therefore setting thread name with ThreadNameInformation is an operation that is not considered privileged and should work very reliably, just like THREAD_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION to retrieve the thread name.\n\n\n\nFrom WinDbg, the !poolfind command can be used to filter by tag name, in this case ThNm (0x6d4e6854), or query !pool with the address from the field _ETHREAD!ThreadName. This confirms that we fully control the content and size of pools. To be in the large pool, the chunk must be of at least 0x1000 bytes, making the minimum actual pool data size of 0x1000-0x10 bytes (for the header). And for the maxiumum allocatable size, during this experiment it was shown possible to allocate thread name up to 0xfff0 bytes (65520):\n\n\n\n\nWhich makes sense, since larger size would overflow the Length field of the UNICODE_STRING (i.e. sizeof(WORD)), which is checked during the NtSetInformationThread(ThreadNameInformation) syscall.\nWe have a reliable way to write from userland a large pool chunk and predict accurately its location in the kernel. Additionally the allocation operation is done per-thread, meaning that for more space it is possible to create more threads (CreateThread() locally or OpenProcess() + CreateRemoteThread() remotely).\nOk cool, but so what?\nLeverage as exploit primitive\nAlthough there’s no vulnerability there, one could use this technique to dump some data in the kernel in a vulnerability exploitation scenario such as an arbitrary write. One possible use case would be to store the addresses of a ROP sequence to disable SMEP. However, to achieve this the attacker must know the address where this pool in the kernel. Luckily we found the answer in the kernel “Large Pool” allocator. Former analysis on the big pool allocator have shown some interesting properties, but what makes it perfect is the NtQuerySystemInformation() syscall with the undocumented SystemBigPoolInformation(0x42) as class information, which provides exactly what we were looking for: the enumeration of all large pools with their kernel addresses, their size, and their tag.\nThis is enough to dump such information:\n\nIf large enough the buffer pBuffer will be populated by the kernel by N entries of SYSTEM_BIGPOOL_ENTRY structured as follow:\n\nWhich becomes trivial to parse to get the thread kernel address, simply by looking up for the entry that would match the condition strncmp( info-&gt;PoolTag, \"ThNm\", 4)==0. In the case of multi-threaded process with many ThreadName entries, it is possible to refine the search by using the size as a secondary search index:\n\nThat’s pretty much it. Put it all together and you get:\n\nSome more advanced feng-shui can be achieved using NtSetInformationThread(ThreadNameInformation) which will be covered in a later post. Although convenient and really stealth, this technique is not bullet-proof since the syscall (if successful) is logged and may be exposed with ETW (see nt!EtwTraceThreadSetName).\nWhat about local DoS? Well yes, it is a pretty simple to destabilize the system by resource exhaustion by creating a loop of CreateThread() + AllocateBigPool($newThread): since it is possible to make each thread of a process allocate a chunk of 0x10000 bytes, simple math will show that creating a somewhat acceptable number of threads, say 0x1000 will bring the total allocation to 0x10000000 bytes (268MB). Not only can the number of threads per process be increased, but the same process can be launched many times. As mentioned earlier, the _ETHREAD!ThreadName field is allocated as NonPagedPoolNx so all those chunks will never be paged out or freed until the thread (or process) is finished/terminated. Although this DoS is pretty dummy and useless, the only annoying part is that it can be triggered by even low integrity/privilege processes. Running it leads to an interesting scenario of memory pressure where the CPUs are not used but the system is unusable since pool allocation request will fail.\nAs a side note, on my test VM (Windows 10 RS5 with 2 vCpus and 2GB of RAM), I could force a process to spawn ~0xb900 threads before the system became unusable.\n\n\nFinal words\nThis post has shown that the apparently innocent new field _ETHREAD.ThreadName that appeared in Windows 1607 can be subverted to do a lot more than intended. But that’s definitely not all, some more esoteric (cough malware) could use this for stealth data persistence, or even covert channel (writing a tiny chat application based on the code above was fairly simple, and is left as an exercise to the reader). The thread name pool stays reachable in memory either until the thread is terminated, or another call to NtSetInformationThread(ThreadNameInformation) is done to this thread. This is convenient because some threads should unlikely die during the time of a session making such nice syscall a good place for hiding stuff.\nThat’s it for this little daily experiment.\nUntil next time, cheers ☕️\nSome links for further reading\n\nBlackHat DC 2011 - Mandt - Kernel Pool exploitation\nExploiting a Windows 10 PagedPool off-by-one\nSheep Year Kernel Heap Fengshui: Spraying in the Big Kids’ Pool\n\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2019-03-17-small-dumps-in-the-big-pool/","title":"Small dumps in the big pool"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2020-03-09-unexpected-logic-bug-win32k/":{"body":"The short version\nThe short version is that there’s a small logic bug in  user32!EndTask() which doesn’t really check the HWND handle passed when forcefully killing the process, allowing unprivileged process to BSoD the host by killing the critical process csrss.

Starting playing around, I remembered that GetDesktopWindow() will return a valid handle to the desktop window, but has many interesting properties including that that it is owned by csrss.exe. That can be quickly demonstrated using the following code:\n\nwhich will output the PID of CSRSS\n\n\n\nIn turn, CSRSS will consume that message and call winsrvext!SrvEndTask() then winsrvext!EndTask().

So this is my notes about how trying to totally understand the exploitation of CVE-2020-0796 (#2), I ended up struggling finding good explanation about a critical structure of Windows paging mechanism: the “Self-Reference PML4 Entry”.\nDisclaimer: If you came here for new stuff, so let me put your mind at peace: There’s nothing new here, I don’t claim to find anything what’s being found and said by people way smarter, and I have probably understood it wrong anyway so don’t judge/quote me. Also the post will only talk be about x64 and Windows here (and having a (L)KD open can help to follow along).\nMMU 101\nAlthough this post won’t be only about the MDL (there’s a book for that #3), some background is required for understanding why there is a need for the so-called Self-Reference PML4 entry. The root question for that is a simple (but not trivial) one: how does the processor read/write a block of physical memory, only by knowing the virtual address, or in layman’s term, how to go from Virtual Address to Physical Address?\nSegmentation\nOn Intel and AMD processors, a virtual address is a combination of a segment number and a linear address, or segment_number:linear_address and even on 64b architecture segmentation is still necessary. So in long mode, a code virtual address is never just 0xLinearAddress but always cs:0xLinearAddress, data is ds:0xLinearAddress, stack is ss:0xLinearAddress, and so on, where cs, ds, ss register holds a WORD value corresponding to an index (with the 2 least significant bit OR-ed, designating the CPL) . The segment number will be added to the value of the register gdtr and will get the segment descriptor:\n\nWhich we can parse combined with the format given by the AMD manual:\n\n\n\n(Src: AMD Programmer’s Manual Volume 2)\n\nThe CPL being given by the 2 lowest bytes of CS, it is now easy to understand how the CPU performs privilege check: by simply comparing the CPL from CS register and DPL from the segment descriptor, or if you prefer a visual diagram from the AMD manual:\n\n\n\n(Src: AMD Programmer’s Manual Volume 2)\nAs we saw earlier, the Address and Limit parts of the descriptor are equal to 0 in Long-Mode (64-bit) - this may be the source of confusion I read in some blog posts (but no name shaming, it’s not the point 😋).\nAlso if you’re lazy (like me) and addicted to WinDbg (like me), the dg command will pretty-print all those info for you:\n\nThere is plenty more to say about the segmentation mechanism on x86, but for our purpose (reminder: how does the CPU goes from VA to PA?), we’ll stick to those basic highlights.\nPaging\nPreparing this post, I came across this blog post that \n@33y0re\n\n wrote recently, and where he did a really good job summarizing how paging works on x86-64 long-mode, and how to explore it on Windows. Therefore I will send you reader to his article, and assume from then on you know of PML4, PDPT, PD, PT and what a canonical linear address is.\nThe best summary can be given by this diagram (again from AMD’s manual)\n\n\n\nSource: AMD Programmer’s Manual Volume 2\nWhat &amp; why the hell is “Self-Reference PML4 entry” ?\nBack to the problem at hand, i.e. understand how does the CPU go from VA to PA, there is an intrinsic problem: the CPU only uses virtual address so how could the processor manipulates the permissions, flags, etc. of those PTEs which are physical? Simply by mapping the PTE tables in VAS, right? But that creates a recursive problem, because we still don’t know how to go from VA to PA. And that’s precisely where “Self-Reference PML4 entry” comes in. But let’s go back a bit.\nWhen a new process is created, a new PML4 is also allocated holding the physical root address for our process address space. From that physical root address and with all the offsets from the VA itself, the MDL can crawl down the physical page directories until getting the wanted data (see “Paging” above). This physical address is stored in the nt!_KPROCESS structure of the process, precisely in _KPROCESS.DirectoryTableBase.\nTo experiment this behavior, we can create a simple program that will only int3 so that KD gets the hand while still in user-mode:\n\nCompile and execute, and as expected KD notifies the breakpoint:\n\nSo when a process switch occurs, the kernel can move nt!_EPROCESS.KernelObject.Pcb.DirectoryTableBase into cr3 (that mov operation forcing the TLB cache being flushed), given the newly running process the illusion of having a clean full virtual address space, and by the same way physically isolating processes.\nBut we slightly digressed, back to the topic: in order to map in the VAS our PML4 which is in physical address space, the kernel needs a way to always know at least one entry of the PML4: this is the “Self-Reference Entry”. Also seen to be called “auto-entry”, the Self-Reference Entry (or “self-ref entry” for short) is a special PML4 index (so then only 9-bit in size) that only the kernel knows (hence between 0x100-0x1ff), and whose content points the physical address of the PML4 itself. By doing so, Windows kernel gives itself an easy way to reach by a virtual address, any directory (PML4, PDPT, PDE, etc.).\nOn Windows 7, the self-ref entry index is a static value (0x1ed) whereas Windows 10 randomizes it on boot. So to understand why this Self-Reference Entry is helpful, let’s process a virtual address like the MDL would: the PML4 index corresponds to the 39:47 bits of a VA, so the value 0x1ed (or 0b111101101) would be as follow:\n\nSo for all Windows from 7 to 10 TH2, the PML4 table of all processes was always mapped at the same range 0xFFFFF680`00000000 → 0xFFFFF6FF`FFFFFFFF. The randomization was added by Windows 10 RS1.\nSo let’s translate a special VA 0xFFFFF6FB`7DBED000‬ to a physical address (PA): by decomposing its indexes we get:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        the output is from my PageExplorer.js WinDbg script.\n\n        \n\nThe PML4E of the current process can be reached at CR3 + 0x1ed*@$ptrsize: but the content is the base physical address of the PML4 itself again! So the PDPE will itself also translate to the PML4 and so on until we read the PTE+offset which again will return the base address of the PML4 (because offset=0)! So what we get is an easy way to read the content of not just the PML4 itself, but any page directory, and all simply by knowing that 9-bit value (and therefore, calculating the corresponding PXE)! So you can artificially create VA simply by their offset, for instance to read the PageTable instead?\n\nAnd build the address as\n\nAnd you get the value: 0xFFFFF680`00000000.\nThat’s why older versions of Windows (which did not randomized the Self-Reference entry and had it hardcoded at 0x1ed) offered a great avenue for defeating KASLR even remotely because you knew for sure always where the PageTable was, and there was a way to browse all pages of a process without ever faulting. And even on modern recent Windows 10, it still means with an arbitrary write you can defeat KASLR and SMEP/SMAP together.\nTo summarize (or if you just jumped to the end of this section), what’s awesome about the Self-Reference PML4 Entry is that knowing only 9 bits (for example 0x1ed) we can easily dump physical memory!\nWhat about Windows 10 RS1+?\nUp until Windows 10 TH2, the magic index for the Self-Reference PML4 entry was 0x1ed as mentioned above. But what about Windows 10 from 1607? Well Microsoft uped their game, as a constant battle for improving Windows security the index is randomized at boot-time, so 0x1ed is now one of the 512 possible values (i.e. 9-bit index) that the Self-Reference entry index can have. And side effect, it also broke some of their own tools, like the !pte2va WinDbg command.\nOn Windows 2004 x64, 0xFFFFF680`00000000 points to nothing (at least most of the times 🤓)\n\nBut is it really 512 values for the entry? Well no, because the most significant bit must be set to 1 for the Sign-Extension to properly make it a kernel canonical address. So it is more 256 values (from 0x100 to 0x1ff). If we’re in KD, this index can be retrieved by a new global symbol nt!MmPteBase, and so the self-reference entry can be known as:\n\nIn our current KD session on a Windows 2004 (on Hyper-V), the self-reference entry has the index of 0x1f1. So now we have the PML4 index, we can craft the virtual address to get its physical address:\n\ncalculate the PTE VA\n\n\n\nget the entry info\n\n\nAs we see, for each entry (PML4E, PDPTE, etc.) the base address found is always the same and matches the content of CR3.\nWe can also easily prove this is the self-reference entry index: as stated above, the entry index (in our example 0x1f1) has to be the same for all processes, meaning that if we break into another process context, the kernel PXE will be the same. Let’s try with our int3.exe again:\n\nAnd to confirm the VA points to the correct PA:\n\nSame data, the VA to PA conversion was successful, and the recursive page entries always point to the same PML4 table, at the physical address 0x1b1f7000. It all goes full circle, pretty nice.\nLast, one can ask: is there any kind of randomization of the allocation of the physical pages themselves? Legit question, and I experimented using some LINQ querying:\n\nAcross several reboots in my VM labs, only 2 matches are shown consistently\n\nWindows 2004 x64 Generation 1 (i.e. BIOS)\n\nPIDProcess NamePml4Base\n0x0Idle0x1aa000\n0x4System0x1aa000\n\n\nWindows 2004 x64 Generation 2 (i.e. UEFI)\n\nPIDProcess NamePml4Base\n0x0Idle0x6d4000\n0x4System0x6d4000\n\n0x1aa000 for the physical address of a Gen1 (BIOS) Hyper-V VM, and 0x6d4000 for a Gen2 (UEFI). This seems to partially coincide with what was said in Ricerca’s article (see #1) about the fact that the PML4 for System is at unrandomized physical address in most cases. From my limited testing the following physical addresses were found consistently (for Windows 2004 x64 with Kd):\nPlatformPML4 Base\nNative (UEFI)0x1ba000\nHyper-V Gen1 (BIOS)0x1aa000\nHyper-V Gen2 (UEFI)0x6d4000\nVirtualBox (BIOS)0x1aa000\nVirtualBox (UEFI)0x1ad000\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        if you have other values on your environment (Qemu, VMware), feel free to contact me and I’ll update the table with the result of the KD command\n\n        \n\n\nAnd this is really the subtlety of Ricerca’s exploit: they showed that only with a fixed physical address (associated to the SYSTEM process), and a fixed virtual area (the nt!_KUSER_SHARED_DATA section at 0xfffff780`00000000) that is always at a known location since NT4, one can create an MDL used in Direct Memory Access, and achieve arbitrary read to virtual addresses simply by recursing through the PML4E, the PDPTE, etc. just like the MDL does. Since they could read the PML4 entirely at a fixed physical address, say 0x1aa000, they could determine the index of the “Self-Reference Entry” from a simple for-loop going through the PML4 page (very approximate pseudo-code):\n\nI hope not to make it sound simple, it is not and took me quite some time to figure out, so massive props to \n@hugeh0ge`](https://twitter.com/hugeh0ge) and [`@_N4NU_\n\n for the implementation.

So quickly Google turned me to Windows AppContainers which the MSDN details the implementation well-enough.\n\nAppContainers are not new and by the look of it, they are here to stay. They were introduced in Windows 8 as an in-kernel isolation mechanism (a-la seccomp for Linux) and are the default model for UWP applications which a simple look at the new Calculator in Process Hacker shows immediately:\n\n\n\nAs the MSDN mentions, AppContainers operates on 6 levels of isolation, each programmatically customizable:\n\nThe File isolation\noperates by creating for the AppContained process its own sandbox and named object subtree. This allows the kernel to finely control access to the FS by the contained process.\nThe Network isolation\nwill prevent any communication from/to the process over the network unless explicitly given permissions (and they have relatively explicit names, for instance WinCapabilityInternetClientSid to allow Internet access as a client - see [WELL_KNOWN_SID_TYPE enumeration])\nThe Process isolation\nmakes the process unable to get a handle to any process outside the sandbox\nAnd Window isolation which\nmakes the process unable to target the Window of other processes.\nThere’s also Device isolation and Credential isolation but I haven’t played too much around those yet… Maybe a next post…\n\nA useful feature added is the DllCharacteristics flag IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_APPCONTAINER - 0x1000 that will prevent a specific DLL image from being located outside an AppContained environment.\nAppContainer, where are you?\nAppContainers being session specific, they are linked to the Session Id: more precisely objects of the container will reside in the \\Sessions\\&lt;SessionId&gt;\\AppContainerNamedObjects\\&lt;AppContainerSid&gt;\n\nAs for file/folder objects, they will be located in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\&lt;NameOfTheContainer&gt;, easily deletable. With each container within the same session being isolated from each other, no real damage can be done outside the sandbox* as everything will be un-done when deleting it (* permissions given depending). So AppContainers was perfect for my case, I just needed a small tool to create AppContainers on-demand - as I couldn’t find any pre-existing provided by MS.\nBuilding an AppContainer Process\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        All the snippets below are C/C++ used in my pwn++ library. Refer to the source code for the full implementation. Additionally, as I was already implementing my own version, I stumbled upon \n@zodiacon\n\n. You might prefer reading/using it if you want a serious implementation.\n\n        \n\n\nCreate an AppContainer profile\nThat’s as simple as it gets: there’s an API exactly for that CreateAppContainerProfile\n\nAdd the desired capabilities\nThis was slightly trickier: to expose a specific capability or file/folder access to the container we must rely on Windows object ACL mechanism.\n\nInsert the capability set to the startup info\nNot unlike process reparenting, appcontainerization requires to define a set of attribute as part of the extended startup information structure:\n\nStart the process\nAll that’s left now, is simply to invoke CreateProcess and we get the AppContained process.\n\nSurprisingly not hard to implement in C/C++ (and by extension also in C#), I’m surprised to see this rather efficient sandbox mechanism not being more broader to encapsulate legacy Win32 apps which functionally require only a small set of permissions available.\nResult\nThe complete functional command line tool AppContainMe[3] that uses the AppContainer implementation allows to launch contained process:\n\nIt’s not complete but does the trick for me: without any option, the process will be spawn without any access to the FS (except the subtree allocated to the container in LocalAppData), no network access, no capability etc. So for example, we can start a totally harmless powershell session and obverse the process runs without any privilege (powershell cannot even get to our home directory).\n\n\n\n\nIt won’t also have any network access:\n\nOr process listing:\n\nSo that confirms all the “isolation” points that are stated in the MSDN. It also works perfectly well for Win32 GUI apps, for PDF Readers\n\n\n\nAlso, for having lightweight web browsing sessions (like with qtweb.exe)\n\n\n\nThat’s pretty much it for this small post about AppContainers. If you want to play out-of-the-box with AppContainMe, a release archive with all the files is here.\nCredits &amp; Links\nShout out to Pavel Yosivovich for his article and tool on AppContainer.

It is a pretty well documented user-land mechanism, and so is its kernel driver API. My curiosity was around its inner working, and all the few (but brilliant) resources can be found in the link section below.\nWhat I wondered was: How is the registry handled in the kernel by the CM? So in the same way that I explored other Windows subsystems, I tried to keep a practical approach, and the result was this WinDbg Js script, RegistryExplorer.js [1] that’ll be referring to throughout this post. This script allows to browse and query via LINQ the registry in a kernel debugging session.\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        This is a collection of notes, do not blindly trust, assume mistakes. Also, you’ll find the KD commands are given to reproduce easily, but your offset/index may vary. Last, everything was done/tested against Windows 10 x64 1909: I assume those findings to be applicable to other versions, but it may not be the case.\n\n        \n\nOverview\nThe Registry consists of a set of regular structures called “Hives”. Off-memory, they live in regular file (usually but not necessarily suffixed as .dat - ex: %USERPROFILE%\\NTUSER.dat). Each .dat file operates as a small File System with its own hierarchy and nomenclature:\n\nRegistry: Collection of (2) Hives (+ metadata) → PRIMARY + .LOG\nHive: Collection of Bins (+ metadata), follows a tree structure\nBin: Collection of Cells (+ metadata), bin size must be aligned to PAGE_SIZE\nCell: Basic unit of allocation for the registry (contains raw data). The Cell size is declared as the 1st ULONG of the memory area. Those are critical, we’ll develop how below.\n\nAs a tree, a Hive can be browsed, exposing:\n\nKeys (or Key Nodes), comparable to Directories in the traditional FS world\nValues (comparable to Files), each of which can have one of 12 types: REG_NONE, REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_BINARY, REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN, REG_DWORD, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, REG_LINK, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_RESOURCE_LIST, REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR, REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST, REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN, REG_QWORD\n\nTherefore a Key can contain Sub-Keys but also Values, just like a folder can contain sub-folders and files. Later on, we’ll explain how to enumerate them, as we must go over some pre-requisites first. It could be noted that the analogy of a typical File System is true to the point where it is possible to abuse some situations via Symbolic Links (exploiting REG_LINK types) but we won’t be covering that today.\n\n    \n        \n        Tip\n    \n        \n        For convenience, the following equivalence will be used throughout this post:\n\nTop-Level Keys = Root Keys\nSub Keys = Keys (as long as they aren’t Root Keys)\n\n\n        \n\nThe best structure definition of a Hive I could find comes from “Windows Kernel Internals NT Registry Implementation”[2] (you’ll find many references to the PDF in this post).\n\n\n\nSome hives are loaded very early in the boot process, as the BCD needs to retrieve its configuration settings from it in the CM hive; and also during kernel loading, hardware info are exposed from the HARDWARE hive. Once parsed and loaded from file to memory, all the system hives are linked via a LIST_ENTRY whose head is pointed by the exposed symbol nt!CmpHiveListHead, and can be iterated over as a list of nt!_CMHIVE object using the nt!_CMHIVE.HiveList field. Therefore a quick parsing can be done with our best friends WinDbg + DDM, which allows us to do some LINQ magic:\n\nwhich looks familiar. This command exposes all the _CMHIVE objects loaded by the kernel, but hives themselves can be manipulated via their handle of type _HHIVE (accessible from nt!_CMHIVE.Hive) which allows, thanks to callback members (i.e. function pointers in the structure), to declare how to get access to data, allocate/free new nodes, etc.\nAccessing the registry\nAn essential pre-requisite to understand how values are accessed in the kernel, is to understand 2 critical structures: Cells and Key Nodes (for now).\nAccording to “Windows Kernel Internals NT Registry Implementation”[2], a Cell (p.12) is:\n\nThe unit of storage allocation within the hive […]\nUsed to store raw data, and build up logical data\n\nKeys, values, security descriptors, indexes etc all are made up of cells\nFetching in a key, might involve several faults spread across the hive file\n\n\n\nA Key Node (of internal type nt!_CM_KEY_NODE) is the structure inside the tree that will allow to access Cells (don’t worry Cells will be amply covered below - for now just think of it as the raw data). For a given key node, its Values (~files) are pointed by the field nt!_CM_KEY_NODE.ValueList, of type nt!_CHILD_LIST; and its subkeys (~sub-folders) via nt!_CM_KEY_NODE.SubkeyLists. This is always true, except for symbolic links (type = REG_LINK), which will dereference the node they point to via the field nt!_CM_KEY_NODE.ChildHiveReference.\nSo when by browsing a key node, what to pay attention to are:\n\nthe SubKey list (i.e. ~subfolders)\n\n\n\nthe Value list (i.e. ~files)\n\n\nAnd looking up a specific Value can be summarized as such:\n\n\n\nSource[2]\nAs we see from the symbols, Value and SubKey lists are not designated by direct pointers in memory, but instead by indexes. Those indexes point to Cells, which contains either the data itself or the next key node to parse to reach the data. We’ve kept mentioning Cells without covering it, it now becomes important to do so, know how Cells are, how they work and how they can be accessed.\nCells\nThe Cell is the basic storage unit for a Hive: what this means is that all data of the hive can be found by knowing 2 pieces of information, a handle to the hive (_HHIVE) and the Cell Index - a Cell is never pointed to directly. In the PDF by Dr B. Probert, a good technical overview of cells can be found, and the key points are:\n\nReferenced as a ‘cell index’ (HCELL_INDEX)\nCell index is offset within the file (minus 0x1000 – the header) – ULONG\nSize rounded at 8 bytes boundary\nIf Index &amp; 1&lt;&lt;31 , then the cell is Volatile ; Else Permanent\nIf Cell.Size &gt;= 0 , Cell.Status = Free ; Else Cell.Status = Allocated &amp;&amp; Cell.RealSize = -Cell.Size\n\nAs for the exact type, ReactOS helps us with the exact definition:\n\nSo the cell index is a ULONG, which can be decomposed as a bitmask that allows to determine more information such as the cell Type (Permanent vs Volatile) and the Block; information which can be extracted from the Index as such:\n\nReactOS\nNow how do we go from the key node to a cell, assuming we have a hive handle and an index? Remember above when we mentioned that the procedure to get to the cell is a function pointer inside the hive handle: nt!_HHIVE.GetCellRoutine? Well, that’s how. Also interestingly, all the hive handles are pointing to the same function nt!HvpGetCellPaged, although it doesn’t have to be the case:\n\nBy reversing it in IDA, it reveals the exact behavior for fetching cells (below shown in a simplified pseudo-C code):\n\nWith that in mind, we can craft an equivalent function GetCellAddress that we can use in WinDbg, which given a hive handle and an index will return the cell address in memory (in WinDbg JS):\n\nSuch function is critical to navigate correctly in the hive, and we’ll refer to it in the rest of the article as GetCellAddress(). If you remember the lookup slide, you’ll realize that the function is “incorrect”: in its state it’ll return the address of the beginning of the Cell, which holds the size (as a ULONG). Therefore to get the address of the data of the Cell, simply add sizeof(ULONG) (or 4) to the result.\nIt was interesting to me to find that the engineers behind the CM have decided to go with this function pointer approach for hives, instead of a static one but couldn’t find one (if you know, let me know!). And hey, it makes any form of kernel hooking for the registry a lot easier so it’s great for us!\nEnumerating Values\nNow that we’ve understood the logic behind Cells and how to navigate through them, the rest is easier to understand. As we’ve mentioned before, “Key Values” are roughly the equivalent of a regular filesystem files. To get the values of a specific key node, one can use the field nt!_CM_KEY_NODE.ValueList (of type _CHILD_LIST) we’ve briefly discussed above.\n\nThen it’s as simple as it gets: the structure gives us the number of values and the Cell Index of the array (of the form of an array of size _CHILD_LIST.Count x sizeof(HCELL_INDEX)) of all the values of this key node. Then we simply iterate through the list of HCELL_INDEX using GetCellAddress(KeyHive, Index) to get the Key Nodes of type CM_KEY_VALUE_SIGNATURE: the type CM_KEY_VALUE_SIGNATURE will indicate that the current node has a structure of nt!_CM_KEY_VALUE, where the actual content and content length can be read.\n\n_CM_KEY_VALUE.Data doesn’t contain a pointer to the data, but again an HCELL_INDEX: so we need to call again GetCellAddress() on this index (we stay on the same hive), and finally retrieve the data.\nEnumerating SubKeys\nBy knowing how cells work it is possible to know how subkeys will be linked: subkeys are just _CM_KEY_NODE objects. the structure gives 2 fields\n\nThe important one is SubKeyLists which is an array of 2 (… you guessed it …) Cell Indexes (HCELL_INDEX). The reasons each array has 2 entries, is to differentiate between Permanent SubKeys (at index 0), and Volatile subKeys (at index 1). To iterate through a tree, there needs to be a root. And the hive root node cell index is given by the field RootCell of the _HBASE_BLOCK, which the hive handle always holds a reference to, via the BaseBlock field:\n\ngraph LR;\n    A[_HHIVE] -- \".BaseBlock\" --&gt; B[\"_HBASE_BLOCK\"];\n    B -- \"GetCellAddress(.RootCell)\" --&gt; C[\"_CM_INDEX[0]\"];\n    B -- \"GetCellAddress(.RootCell)\" --&gt; E[\"_CM_INDEX[1]\"];\n    B -- \"GetCellAddress(.RootCell)\" --&gt; F[\"_CM_INDEX[...]\"];\n    C -- \".Cell\" --&gt; D[\"_CM_KEY_NODE\"];\n\nAs we shown before from the linked list of _CMHIVE from nt!CmpHiveListHead we can iterate through all the system hives. Each hive object has a pointer to a handle of hive (_HHIVE) which exposes a _DUAL field named Storage: the index 0 is used for permanent storage, index 1 for volatile\n\nTo summarize more graphically\n\ngraph LR;\n    Z(nt!CmpHiveListHead) --&gt; X[\"_CMHIVE\"];\n    X-- \".Hive\" --&gt; Y[\"_HHIVE\"];\n    Y-- \".Storage[0=Permanent,1=Volatile]\" --&gt; W[_HMAP_DIRECTORY]\n\nThe subkeys will be located in the Map element (of type _HMAP_DIRECTORY). The _HMAP_DIRECTORY structure simply contains 1 element, a table of 1024 _HMAP_TABLE, each of them structured of 1 element: a Table of 512 _HMAP_ENTRY.\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A[_HMAP_DIRECTORY] --&gt; B[\"_HMAP_TABLE[0]\"];\n    A[_HMAP_DIRECTORY] --&gt; C[\"_HMAP_TABLE[1]\"];\n    A[_HMAP_DIRECTORY] --&gt; D[\"_HMAP_TABLE[..]\"];\n    A[_HMAP_DIRECTORY] --&gt; E[\"_HMAP_TABLE[1023]\"];\n    B --&gt; F[\"_HMAP_ENTRY[0]\"];\n    B --&gt; G[\"_HMAP_ENTRY[1]\"];\n    B --&gt; H[\"_HMAP_ENTRY[..]\"];\n    B --&gt; I[\"_HMAP_ENTRY[511]\"];\n\nThe last nibble of PermanentBinAddress is used for meta-data, so we can bitwise AND it with ~0xf. Finally to access the data, we simply must add the BlockOffset value, and the final Offset retrieved from AND-ing the Index to 0xfff. This is a the behavior that the function GetCellAddress() will do for us to painlessly get the virtual address of a cell, just from a hive handle and an Index.\nPut it all together\nAs a learning exercise, I always try to build a script/tool when digging into a topic, and here the result is another WinDbg JS script, RegistryExplorer.js[1] which will allow to navigate through the registry using WinDbg Debugger Data Model (and therefore also query it via LINQ)\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Note\n    \n        \n        a better version was done by \n@msuiche\n\n here[^3]\n\n        \n\nExample:\n\nOr the click-friendly version 😀\n\n\nPractical Toy Example: dumping SAM\nAny beginner pentester would (should?) know that in user-mode, a local Administrator account has enough privilege to dump the SAM &amp; SYSTEM hives from the command line using reg.exe: (* If you didn’t know, I’d suggest reading this[3] ASAP)\n\nSame goes for SYSTEM.\nHowever, even as Administrator trying to access using regedit.exe the subkeys of HLKM\\SECURITY and SAM will be denied as they require NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privilege which is only a half protection, as psexec /s would be enough to bypass it. So with that in mind, in theory, RegistryExplorer.js gives us everything we need to fetch those values.\nAnd then real life strikes…\nIssue #1\nAs I was trying to get those values manually, the initial script failed (crashed) complaining there was an invalid access to user-mode memory:\n\nIt seemed that the cells for accessing the SAM were at some points hitting user-mode area, in a process different than System, so the address access walking the wrong page table, and hence the exception from WinDbg. Which got immediately confirmed:\n\nThen how does the kernel know where to fetch this information? Well it turned out that the hive handle can hold reference to a process in its ViewMap.ProcessTuple attribute, of type _CMSI_PROCESS_TUPLE which holds both a handle to the _EPROCESS and a pointer to the _EPROCESS. We can use that information to determine the backing process:\n\nIt points to the Registry process, which makes sense. To confirm, we can switch to the context of the process, and try to re-access the UM address 0x280f6fa1850:\n\nThe signature kn (0x6b6e) at 0x280f6fa1850+sizeof(ULONG) confirms we’re hitting the right spot.\nIssue #2\nNow I could access some keys &amp; values but not everything:\n\nThe 2nd issue faced was that when trying to access some keys in UM for the HKLM\\SAM hive, WinDbg would inconsistently return some access violation error. This reason was somewhat easier to figure out the cause, less easy for a programmatic remediation.\n\nThe cause behind it was not the calculation method of the Cell address but due to the fact that the page was paged out. The clue for me was the fact the missing is usually surrounded by other mapped pages.\n\nI didn’t find a way to solve this programmatically (i.e. force WinDbg to page-in), although just a reboot is enough to make sure the desired pages are still in memory. Then we can finally access the keys and values:\n\nSo then to dump the keys for the Administrator (UID=500=0x1f4)\n\nAnd done, we’ve got the data! We can now totally navigate the Registry from a KD session!\nOutro\nUnderstanding those bits of the CM took more work than I imagined, but as it was nicely engineered, it was fun to go through. The CM is way more complex than that, but this is the basics: we didn’t cover more advanced stuff like the use of the .LOG file, the memory management of the CM and other funkiness, but I hope this article was interesting and useful to you and thanks for making it this far.\nPeace out ✌\nReferences\n\n\ncomaeio/SwishDbgExt\n\n\n\nreactos/reactos\n\n\nWindows Internals 6th - Part 1, Chapter 4: Management Mechanism - The Registry\nEnumerating Registry Hives - moyix\n\n\n\nRegistryExplorer.js ↩ ↩2\n\n\nWindows Kernel Internals NT Registry Implementation ↩ ↩2 ↩3\n\n\nDumping Windows Credentials by \n@lanjelot\n\n ↩\n\n\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2021-01-10-browsing-registry-kernel-mode/","title":"Browsing the registry in kernel-mode"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2022-07-14-setup-hyperv-kdcom/":{"body":"How to use Hyper-V to debug using KdCOM from 2 VMs, one debugging the other.\nDebuggee\nFollow the setup here to setup a BCD profile for KdCom in the VM.

One thought that occurred to me was that even though a section is created from user or kernel land, its mapping can be in user-mode as much as in kernel (when called from the kernel).\nWindows Section Objects\nFor quick reminder, a Section Object on Windows is a specific type of kernel object (of structure nt!SECTION) that represents a block of memory that processes can share between themselves or between a process and the kernel. It can be mapped to the paging file (i.e. backed by memory) or to a file on disk, but either can be handled using the same set of API, and even though they are allocated by the Object Manager, it is one of the many jobs of the Memory Manager to handle their access (handle access, permission, mapping etc.). In usermode the high level API is kernel32!CreateFileMapping, which after some hoops into kernelbase, boils down to ntdll!NtCreateSection\n\n\n\nThe signature is as follow:\n\nIf successful, the syscall will return a section handle in SectionHandle, which will refer to an instance of a nt!_SECTION. Therefore the handle will be added to the handle table of the calling process, accessible from kernel and user modes unless OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE is specified in the ObjectAttributes. This will be important for us in the following, because it implies that if the process terminates, so will the section object.\nIn itself the Section Object doesn’t have a lot going on, unless it is mapped to memory. This is achieved through kernel32!MapViewOfView(Ex) which again, boils down to the syscall ntdll!NtMapViewOfSection, whose signature is as follow:\n\nReversing this function is relatively straight forward:\n\nwhich makes us jump to:\n\nWhat matters the most here would be the BaseAddress argument which will hold the UM address of the mapping. Meaning that Section Objects can be used to create communication channels between kernel &lt;-&gt; user mode (on top of obviously user &lt;-&gt; user). This is particularly nice especially because it allows to control finely the permission to the area: for instance a driver could create a section as read-writable, map its own view as RW, but expose to any process as RO. As a matter of fact, this is exactly how Windows 11 decided to protect the (K)USER_SHARED_DATA memory region, frequently used by kernel exploit since it’s read/writable in ring-0 at a well-known address, making it a perfect way to bypass ALSR. The protection was added in 22H1 global variable which is initialized at boot-time and mapped as RW from the kernel through the nt!MmWriteableUserSharedData; however from user-mode only a read-only view is exposed to processes.  For complete details about that protection, I invite the reader to refer to Connor McGarr’s in-depth excellent blog post on the subject.\nSection Object as a Kernel/User Communication Vector\nPurely coincidentally, a colleague of mine stumbled upon a problem where they wanted to be able to capture the user-mode context of a thread from a driver, through PsGetThreadContext. The tricky part here was that PsGetThreadContext() follows the following signature:\n\nLink\nWhere ThreadContext is the linear address to write the thread CONTEXT passed as first argument. However, the 3rd argument, PreviousMode matters the most: if specified as UserMode (1), the function performs a check to make sure the ThreadContext linear address resides within the usermode address range. Since I really love turning theory into practice, I figured this would be a perfect practice case for the technique mentioned above, so I ended up writing a PoC driver to serve that purpose in a (IMHO) fairly nice way. This actually didn’t take long thanks to my driver template and all I had to do was implement the steps which were:\n\nCreate a section in the System process. Why in System? Simply because section handles must be tight to a process: therefore if the section is created in a “normal” process, the handle to it will be close when/if said process terminates, effectively closing the section. So we can use the DriverEntry to make sure the section handle is stored in the System kernel handle table. Save the handle in a global variable.\n\n\nLink\nBy breakpointing at the end of DriverEntry we confirm that the handle resides in the System process.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I can use any callback (process/image notification, minifilter callbacks etc.) to invoke ZwMapViewOfSection, reusing the section handle from the step earlier, and NtCurrentProcess() as process handle.\n\n\nLink\nBaseAddress will return an 64KB-aligned address located randomly (ASLR). The best thing here, is that we also control ZeroBits, allowing to (partly) control where that address will land.\n\nWe’re free to call PsGetThreadContext() with the returned BaseAddress value.\n\n\nLink\nTo prevent any inadverted permission drop of the view (and therefore BSoD-ing us during the call to PsGetThreadContext), we can secure the location using MmSecureVirtualMemory.\nFrom WinDbg we can confirm the VAD is mapped when the breakpoint is hit:\n\n\n\nAnd as soon as the syscall returns, we’re unmapped:\n\n\n\n\nClose the section in the driver unload callback.\n\nThat’s pretty much it: what we’ve got at the end is kernel driver controlled communication vector to any process in usermode: as the section handle is part of System kernel handle table, it’s untouchable from ring-3 unless the driver dictates otherwise by creating a view (with proper permissions) to it. This approach is great as it allows the driver to control everything, but if we want to give a user-mode process some say into it, it’s also possible simply by turning the anonymous section we created for this PoC into a named one, then call sequentially OpenFileMapping(SectionName) then MapViewOfFile(). In addition, it could very well be ported to a process &lt;-&gt; process communication but here I wanted to play with the minifilter callbacks as an on-demand mechanism.\nSide-track\nThe careful reader will have notice that the step introduce a tiny race condition window, where another thread can also access the memory region. That bothered me, so I also examined more advanced options relying on the shared section objects. By nature they involve 2 PTEs:\n\nthe “real” PTE (hardware PTE), effectively used for VA -&gt; PA translation;\nalong with a prototype PTE.\n\nWhen the view is created, the memory manager will create empty PTEs but expect a page fault. This is verified quickly by breaking right after the call to ZwMapViewOfSection\n\nHowever, after the call to PsGetThreadContext the entry is correctly populated:\n\nThe PTE is valid:\n\nSo this means we have a great way to determine whether a physical page was accessed, using MmGetPhysicalAddress(). To test this we invoke it after the mapping (where we expect a null value) and a second time after the call to PsGetThreadContext:\n\n\n\nThe 2nd value for PhyBaseAddress points to the physical address where the function output is stored.\nAt that point, I thought it would be sufficient to stop because we have an effective way to honeypot potential corruptions attempts:\n\nCreate a section with many pages (the more the better)\nDuring the preparation to the invocation of PsGetThreadContext, choose randomly one page that will receive the CONTEXT\nMap all the pages separately\nCall PsGetThreadContext\n\nOnce the call is over, we can use the method above to validate whether any other page than the one we know valid were accessed. If so, discard the result.\nIsn’t Windows awesome?\nEnd\nThere are a lot of possible fun uses of sections, and since I want to try to document more of my “stuff”. Some offensive cool use case would be for instance, would be to expose code “on-demand” to a specific thread/process, removing the mapped execution page(s) from the process VAD as soon as we’re done.\nI’ll try to post follow-up updates.\nFor those interested in the code, you would find a minifilter driver ready to build &amp; compile on the Github project: \nhugsy/shared-kernel-user-section-driver\n\n\nSo, see you next time?\nCredits &amp; References:\n\nWhat Makes It Page\nWindows Internals 7th edition, Part 1\nVergilius Project\nMSDN - Managing Memory Sections\n\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2023-04-04-section-objects-kernel-user-communication-mode/","title":"Section Objects as Kernel/User communication mode"},"https://blahcat.github.io/2024-01-27-tapping-into-the-potential-of-memory-dump-emulation/":{"body":"This post summarizes some of the work I’ve been doing for the past few months during my (few) off times. Nothing new, mostly just a structured reminder for my later self.\nIntroduction\nWhat-The-Fuzz is one of my favorite tools, and beyond the tool itself I really enjoy the story behind the creation of the tool itself and all of the surrounding libraries 0vercl0k had to build, including kdmp-parser, symbolizer, leveraged yrp’s underestimated bochs-based emulation library bochscpu. 0vercl0k explained all of this better than I possible could, so if you haven’t read it yet, please stop reading this post now and read the blog post dedicated to WTF: Building a new snapshot fuzzer &amp; fuzzing IDA.\nI used to use memory dump mostly as a final way to access the crashing condition and execution context of a program before its crash. Dumps are very much used for debugging, fuzzing crash analysis, and sometimes for DFIR (like with the famous - RIP? - Volatility does). But to my knowledge, WTF was the first tool to use them for snapshot-based fuzzing (* if not, please shoot me a remark in the Discussion).\nFollowing the well-known Feynman principle that “what you cannot create, you do not understand”, I wanted to see where digging into this topic will lead me. And boy wasn’t I disappointed… But first and before all, I wanted whatever my work to be Python because:\n\nit is the de-facto language for quick prototyping, comes with an awesome REPL and has a great ecosystem via PyPI\nhas a great capability to interact with lower level machine code\nI know and like the language\n\nSo immediately, I was stopped: originally bochscpu was written in Rust, kdmp-parser and udmp-parser in C++ and only kdmp-parser had an embryo of Python bindings (many API/structures missing, no PyPI). Perfect, so I set myself to completely dive into those libs by\n\ncreating Python bindings for udmp-parser and bochscpu\nimproving the Python bindings kdmp-parser originally had, developed by \nmasthoon\n\n\n\nAt the time of this article, anyone can pip install any of those packages and start playing directly within the Python interpreter 3.8+ on either Windows, Linux and MacOS (since 0.1.7+) So just in order to reproduce any of the stuff mentioned below, all one would need do is:\n\nto be fully set to follow along with the experiments below. Having the pre-requisites we can start digging (because yes, all that initial work was only to get start the intended research) by:\n\nusing udmp-parser  to parse user-mode process dumps\nor using kdmp-parser, to parse kernel memory dumps\nand use those information to reconstitute a workable environment (memory layout, cpu context, etc.) for bochscpu to run whatever code we choose to.\n\nThe best parts (IMO) about all of this was that this whole setup works no matter the process and allow us to get an absolute control over the execution.\nWe will explore each case individually, but first let’s examine a bit more the libraries at hand.\nQuick lib peek\nThis part is important as none of what follows would have been possible without those libraries, it is only fair to promote them first.\nBochs[1]/BochsCPU[2]\nIt is well-known that the Bochs emulator has incredibly powerful instrumentation capabilities and is regarded as being very faithful to the x86 ABI implementation itself (including the most recent extensions). BochsCPU by yrp, on the other hand, is a Rust library that wraps the Bochs CPU code and exposes via Rust API (and C++ via FFI) all the instrumentation points (context switches, interrupts, exceptions, etc) that Bochs does. This makes it a useful tool for tasks such as developing code any X86 mode, dealing with very old, mission-critical software, and assisting in reversing/vulnerability research tasks.\nAnd that’s an amazing environment since Bochs is extremely faithful to what the x86 cpu actually executes, it will be merciless should you fail to prepare the CPU state adequately (missing flags when setting long mode, forgot to reset a trap flag, etc.). Even though that could seem tedious, especially if compared to unicorn/qemu for instance, that abstracts everything beforehand to the dev. But I believe such behavior by forcing to read carefully the Intel manuals to have the expected behavior, it only makes you know X86 CPU better.\nudmp-parser[3]/kdmp-parser[4]\nudmp-parser and kdmp-parser are both cross-platform C++ parser library written by 0vercl0k for Windows memory dumps, respectively for user-mode (using .dump /m in WinDbg) and kernel-mode (.dump /f|/ka in WinDbg) dumps. And cherry on top, both come with Python3 bindings, allowing for quick prototyping.\nWindows Kernel-mode emulation\nArmed with those libraries, running the emulator from a Windows kernel dump is now “relatively” simple (as opposed to user-mode, we’ll detail why in the next part) because the dump is nothing more but a snapshot of the OS state at a given time.\nFirst, always take a solid dump\nFirst from a KdNet session, you can easily create a dump at an interesting point. When looking for interesting attack surface, I like to use my own IRP monitor tool #ShamelessSelfPromo; but for our example really anything would do, like the following:\n\nOne way to get the dump would be using .dump command as such\n\nBut a better way would be to use the yrp’s bdump.js script\n\nBuild the BochsCPU session\nParsing the dump with kdmp_parser.KernelDumpParser is as simple as it gets so let’s leave it to that. For BochsCPU to run it’s critical to have a PF handler callback, which can be done as a simple on-demand basis: full memory dumps can be several gigabytes in size, so it seems unreasonable to map it all on host, especially since when we probably are going to need a fraction of that. This ended up being relatively elegant and simple:\n\nThis gives us a first chance to address missing pages, whereas the PageFault exception triggered by the CPU (i.e PageFault -&gt; BX_PF_EXCEPTION (14) ) will give us a second chance to analyze the page fault, as the error code will be populated, we can check the reason of the fault using the Intel 3A - 4.7 section of the Intel manuals.\nNext, a bochscpu.State must be given to the CPU indicating the context from which to start including the (extended) CR, GPR, flag registers and segment registers. Note that several helpers can be found in bochscpu.cpu to slightly speed up that process.\n\nLast (but technically optionally), define the Bochs callbacks on the plethora of hookable events:\n\nAnd finally kick things off with a simple call\n\n\nFor a complete and more detailed example, the reader can refer to the example in the bochscpu-python repository: examples/long_mode_emulate_windows_kdump.py\nWindows User-mode emulation\nThere are way more than one way of snapshotting a process on Windows (like WinDbg, Task Manager, procdump, processhacker, etc.) so I will skip and assume you have a snapshot ready.\nEmulating usermode code on BochsCPU turned out to be slightly more tricky than kernel mode: the kernel dump includes an almost complete OS snapshot include all the kernel sections required by the MMU to function properly and all what was needed was to map those pages to Bochs whenever they were needed.\nA user-mode dump on Windows does not include any of those information but only that related to the usermode process itself - which, despite being already a lot of information, is insufficient to simply re-use what was done for kernel mode emulation. And we must remember that BochsCPU is only, well, the CPU: meaning it can execute anything but it needs to have everything set it up, such as the processor mode (real, protected, long), the map pages, etc. But then, if the process runs in protected/long mode, memory accesses via the MMU must also be correctly laid off so ensure the VirtualAddress → PhysicalAddress translation works. We therefore, are required to build own page table for the process. Since this process is documented everywhere on the Internet, I will assume the reader to be familiar and skip this part by mentioning that bochscpu-python provides an easy way to expedite the process of setting things up:\n\nA couple of other things are required: the first one is that just like for what was done for kernel dumps, we must import all registers (GPR, flags).\nAnother thing (but related) relies in the thread selection: when the VM execution will resume, the CPU cannot work without relying on the segment registers, which are provided from its state by the values set in the CS, DS, SS segment registers. Thankfully those values can be retrieved straight from the dump:\n\nSimilarly not the CPU but Windows also requires the FS (for protected and long modes) and the GS registers (in long mode).\nOk, now we have built everything need for the emulation to run successfully in a Windows environment. Let’s focus on what could we want to execute next…\nPGTFO\nTL;DR You can predict through emulation the values of Windows PRNG (see examples/long_mode_emulate_windows_udump.py)\nCoincidentally as part of some research I was doing for work on ransomware, I examined the possibility of retrieving session keys used by ransomware, by snapshotting culprit ransomware processes, and generating a using memory dumps using canary files (the full article is available here if interested). As thoroughly detailed in the article, investigating WANNACRY revealed that it uses Windows PRNG to create the AES128 keys for each file. Which triggered the idea behind that post, which was that by using canary files to detect ransomware encryption early one, and generating a dump of the process at that point, can we retrieve all the subsequent symmetric keys (and essentially making ourselves a free decryptor).\nSince snapshotting the process gives us the current state of the PRNG for that process, we can now use emulation to discover the following values. A basic PoC for it would be as follow:\n\n\n\n\nContinuing our emulator from above, we can now invoke directly any function (here we’re interested in cryptbase!SystemFunction036) in the dump:\n\nAnd we can successfully dump all future values:\n\n\n\nSame values, mission accomplished.\nHey, but what about Linux?\nWell as the saying goes…\n\n\n\nusing lief we can parse and populate the memory layout\n\nCompile\n\n\n\nAnd run\n\n\n\nand unsurprisingly, same result\nSimilarly the source of this script too was added to the examples/ folder of bochscpu-python available here so feel free to try it at home 🙂\nBochsPwn (Re-)Reloaded?\nBochsPwn (and BochsPwn-Reloaded) is a project developed by j00ru which leveraged Bochs instrumentation capability to detect (among other things) TOCTOU race conditions in the Windows kernel.\nThe brilliance behind that tool can (partially) become relevant again for kernel memory dumps, by simply tracking executions and memory accesses. This can be achieved crudely by extending the kernel dump runner we had earlier, and adding a callback for linear memory accesses in bochscpu as such:\n\nTesting with HEVD Double-Fetch example, immediately reveals it:\n\nWhich we can double-check with a disassembler (highlighted in magenta)\n\n\nFinal remark\nThis article was made an attempt to structure all my notes over the last few months playing with memory dumps, and by no mean any comparison with WTF: WTF goes way further and does it better, with different emulation techniques and therefore should be used for fuzzing at scale. On the other hand having quick ways to re-create a fully working emulation context (whether user or kernel mode) from a process/memory dump with ~50 lines of Python is not without certain advantages.\nAnyway, as always open for feedback on the discussion feed.\nUntil then see next time,\nCheers 🍻\nReferences\nHere are the links to those giants referred in the title:\n\n\nbochs-emu/Bochs\n\n\n\nyrp604/bochscpu\n\n\n\n0vercl0k/wtf\n\n\n\n0vercl0k/kdmp-parser\n\n\n\n0vercl0k/udmp-parser\n\n\n\ngoogleprojectzero/bochspwn\n\n\n\ngoogleprojectzero/bochspwn-reloaded\n\n\n\n","id":"https://blahcat.github.io/2024-01-27-tapping-into-the-potential-of-memory-dump-emulation/","title":"Tapping into the potential of Memory Dump Emulation"},"https://blahcat.github.io/about/":{"body":"This blog is all about technical stuff, no ads, no cookie or whatever to accept.
